#indump[2, 3, 4, 5]
#indump[2:4, 1:2]

## Ranges must have known compile-time size

Valid: 
x  - 1 item
:x - x items
x:y - y-x items

Invalid

x: - ??? items

All items will be optionals - if an index is out of range at runtime, it'll be None

This allows for a controlled dump in a type safe manner.

Roughly:

function<T>[T~, (Number|Slice)+; T?...] ## Except of course varargs doesn't exist

Inspiration = subscripted uncouple, but in a statically compilable manner

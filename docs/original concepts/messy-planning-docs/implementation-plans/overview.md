## Goals

- LL(1) grammar
- Compile to custom bytecode
- Stack-based VM
- Static typing with inference
- List model with duck shaping
- Eventually, no garbage collector. I believe it is theoretically possible to get away with something like automatically managed reference counting.
- Quite possibly implement first iteration in Scala for its lazy evaluation capabilities

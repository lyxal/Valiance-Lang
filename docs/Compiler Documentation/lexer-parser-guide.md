# Lexer and Parser Guide

This guide is for future agents working on Valiance's lexer, parser, AST node
model, or parser-facing tests. It is intentionally self-contained: do not
assume the reader has loaded any other compiler guide.

The parser's job is not to preserve source order literally. Valiance source is
written as left-to-right chains, but chains execute right-to-left. The parser
therefore lowers chain syntax into the stack order consumed by analysis,
codegen, and runtime.

## Main Files

`src/valiance/parsing/lexer.py`

- Defines `TokenKind`, `Token`, `LexError`, and `lex(source)`.
- Owns comments, strings, numbers, identifiers, operators, data-tag tokens,
  delimiters, and source locations.
- Emits `NEWLINE` tokens because newlines are syntax.

`src/valiance/parsing/parser.py`

- Defines `ParseError`, `Parser`, `parse(source)`, and `parse_type(source)`.
- Owns source-to-AST lowering and type-expression parsing.
- Converts chain syntax into normal stack-order AST.
- Attaches `SourceLocation` to parser-produced AST nodes.
- Parses `@name` annotations before declarations/function literals and
  `@@name` annotations before element calls. Semantics live in
  `analysis/contracts/annotations.py`, not in the parser.

`src/valiance/asts/nodes.py`

- Defines all raw AST dataclasses and typed AST wrappers.
- Parser nodes inherit from `ASTNode`, whose keyword-only `location` is ignored
  for equality comparisons.

`src/valiance/asts/__init__.py`

- Public import surface for AST nodes. Add new AST nodes here when they should
  be used outside `asts.nodes`.

`src/valiance/asts/pretty.py`

- Debug printer for raw and typed AST. Update it when adding node fields that a
  human should see in `valiance analyse` output.

`tests/test_parser.py`

- Main lexer/parser regression suite.
- Prefer small tests that assert the exact AST shape, especially for chain
  lowering and ambiguous delimiters.

## Pipeline

The source pipeline starts here:

```text
source text -> lex(source) -> list[Token] -> Parser(...).parse_program() -> AST nodes
```

The public helpers are:

```python
from valiance.parsing import lex, parse, parse_type

tokens = lex("1 + 2")
program = parse("1 + 2")
typ = parse_type("Function[Number -> String]")
```

`parse()` always runs the lexer first. If a feature needs new punctuation or
token boundaries, change `lexer.py` before changing `parser.py`.

## Lexer Model

The lexer is a hand-written scanner. It walks source text with `index`, `line`,
and `column`, and emits tokens with line, column, and absolute offset.

Important token rules:

- Spaces, tabs, and carriage returns are emitted as `TokenKind.WHITESPACE`. The
  parser skips these tokens centrally during cursor movement and lookahead.
- `\n` emits `TokenKind.NEWLINE`.
- `#?` starts a single-line comment.
- `#??` is reserved by source tooling for documentation comments. The lexer
  deliberately treats it as the existing `#?` comment form; association with
  a following `define` and field parsing live in `source_tools.py`, not in the
  language parser.
- `#/ ... /#` is a nested multiline comment.
- A bare `#name`, `#-name`, `#-name`, or `#name++` is emitted as one `OP` token for data
  tags.
- `"` starts a string. Strings may contain literal newlines. Escaped `"`, `\`,
  and `$` are unescaped; other backslash sequences are preserved with the
  backslash.
- Numbers include signed decimals, scientific notation, and the current complex
  literal form such as `3i4`. Scientific exponents may themselves be real-valued,
  so `1.3e5.2` is one NUMBER token rather than a number followed by field access.
  Numeric inference uses the normalized value: a zero imaginary component does
  not force `Number`, so `1i0` is `Int` and `1.5i0` is `Real`.
- Alphanumeric identifiers use `_` or alphabetic start characters followed by
  `_`, alphabetic characters, or digits.
- Symbolic operators are made from `_OP_CHARS`. `_operator()` emits exactly one
  single-character `OP` token per source character, with that character's own
  offset. It must not emit growing, overlapping substrings such as `+` and `++`
  from the same starting offset.
- Backslash-prefixed niladic names such as `\foo` are emitted as a single `OP`
  token.

When adding tokens:

1. Add the token kind to `TokenKind`.
2. Add single-character punctuation to `_SINGLE` when possible.
3. Put multi-character forms before their prefixes in `_Lexer.lex`.
4. Add a lexer test that checks token kind, value, and location if location is
   relevant.

Do not make the parser infer token boundaries that the lexer can know cleanly.
For symbolic operators, however, the lexer deliberately preserves character-level
boundaries. The parser uses token offsets and whitespace to decide when adjacent
`OP` characters form one element symbol.

## AST Locations

Every parser-created AST node should receive a `location=_loc(token)` from the
token that begins the syntactic construct.

Examples:

- `NumberLiteralNode(..., location=_loc(number_token))`
- `FunctionNode(..., location=_loc(fn_token))`
- `ElementNode(..., location=_loc(element_token))`

`SourceLocation` contains:

```python
SourceLocation(line: int, column: int, offset: int)
```

Tests can compare AST nodes without specifying locations because `ASTNode`
marks `location` as `compare=False`. Add explicit location assertions when a
diagnostic feature depends on the source position.

## Recoverable diagnostics

The strict `lex(source)` and `parse(source)` helpers remain appropriate for
callers that require a valid result. `lex` raises the first `LexError`; `parse`
collects independent lexical and grammatical errors and raises `ParseErrors`
when more than one is present.

Editor and tooling integrations should use the recovery APIs:

```python
from valiance.parsing import lex_with_diagnostics, parse_with_diagnostics

tokens, lex_errors = lex_with_diagnostics(source)
result = parse_with_diagnostics(source)
# result.nodes is the best-effort AST for valid statements.
# result.diagnostics contains source-ordered lexer and parser errors.
```

Lexical recovery emits internal `ERROR` tokens and resumes at the next character
or natural token boundary. Parser recovery is statement-oriented: after an
error it synchronizes at a newline and continues with the next statement. This
is deliberately conservative. It avoids inventing nested AST structure while
still allowing a compiler or language server to report several independent
mistakes in one pass.

Diagnostics should state both the expectation and the token actually found.
When adding grammar, prefer messages such as `expected ')' after argument list`
over generic messages such as `invalid syntax`. Add a focused recovery test
whenever a new construct introduces a useful synchronization boundary.

## Parser Model

The parser is recursive descent over a token list. Its constructor materializes the
token iterator once; do not add debug iteration before `list(tokens)`, because
consuming the iterator there would leave the parser with an empty or truncated
stream.

It exposes a small cursor API:

- `_current`, `_previous`, and `_peek(ahead)`
- `_advance()` and `_peek(ahead)` skip `WHITESPACE` transparently, so every
  lookahead depth refers to meaningful tokens rather than raw list positions
- `_match(...)` to consume optional token kinds
- `_expect(kind)` to require a token kind
- `_match_ident(...)` and `_check_ident(...)` for keyword-like identifiers
- `_error(message)` to raise `ParseError` at the current token

Whitespace handling belongs in `_advance()` and `_peek()`. Do not reintroduce a
separate `_consume_whitespace` step in `_check`, `_expect`, or individual grammar
methods. Central skipping keeps `_peek(1)`, `_peek(2)`, and deeper lookahead
consistent.

The exception is syntax where whitespace itself is significant. `_adjacent(first,
second)` is the single authority for deciding whether two tokens touch in source,
using their offsets and token widths. Grammar code should call `_adjacent` rather
than reproducing offset arithmetic.

Keywords such as `define`, `fn`, `if`, and `while` are currently lexed as
ordinary `IDENT` tokens and recognized by parser methods. Do not add keyword
token kinds unless there is a strong reason.

Top-level parsing flows through:

```text
parse_program()
  -> _statement()
      -> declarations/control flow
      -> _chain_until(...)
```

Declarations and control flow return AST nodes directly. Ordinary expressions
are parsed as chains.

## Indexed update lowering

Stack-receiver augmented index assignments such as ``$[start:stop] := body``
remain one ``IndexUpdateNode`` in the raw AST. The node owns its selector
expressions and update body, so source expressions appear once and parser output
does not expose temporary variables. During analysis, the node is lowered into
the existing typed index-access and index-set operations. That lowering stores
the receiver and evaluated selector values under reserved internal names, which
preserves ambient-stack semantics while guaranteeing that every selector is
evaluated exactly once. User-facing lint rules must ignore these reserved
NUL-prefixed bindings.

Do not lower indexed updates into duplicated selector nodes in the parser. Apart
from making the raw AST misleading, that changes observable behaviour for
selectors with variable reads, writes, calls, or other effects.

## Chain Lowering

This is the most important parser invariant.

Valiance chains are written left to right, but each element in a chain uses the
result of the next element as its rightmost argument. The parser lowers these
chains into stack order.

Examples:

```text
source: 1 + 2
AST:    Number(1), Number(2), Element(+)

source: 3 + 4 * 7
AST:    Number(3), Number(4), Element(+), Number(7), Element(*)

source:
[1, 2, 3]
println length

AST:
ListLiteral(...), Element(length), Element(println)
```

The parser represents each raw chain item as a private `_ChainPiece`:

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True, slots=True)
class _ChainPiece:
    nodes: tuple[ASTNode, ...]
    breaks_chain: bool = False
    is_element: bool = False
```

`_chain_until(terminators)` accumulates pieces until a terminator or `|`, then
calls `_lower_chain_segment`.

Current chain-breaking rules:
- Every expression cast (`as[T]`, `as?[T]`, and `as![T]`) is an executable
  chain separator. It lowers exactly as though a `|` appeared immediately
  before and immediately after the cast: the chain to its left is completed,
  the cast is emitted, and the chain to its right starts independently.

- Literals break chains and are included in the segment they break.
- Variables and parenthesized values break chains.
- `fn`, `if`, `while`, `foreach`, `break`, and `return` break chains.
- List, tuple, record, and dictionary literals break chains.
- Backslash-prefixed niladic element names break chains and are included.
- Element call syntax such as `foo(...)` breaks chains.
- The `:` modifier breaks chains.
- `|`, newlines, closers, `end`, and `else` terminate or split chains.

All-element segments are reversed. A segment ending in a breaker with only
elements to its left emits the breaker first, then those left elements in
reverse. Otherwise, pieces are flattened in source order.

When changing chain behavior, add parser tests before and after the boundary
you are changing. Most regressions here look like elements in the wrong order.

## Expression Terms

`_term()` parses one expression piece. It handles:

- Numbers and strings
- `$` variables, assignments, and variable call syntax
- `.field` access
- List literals: `[...]`
- Record literals: `record{...}`
- Dictionary literals: `dict{...}`
- Parenthesized grouping: `(...)`
- Tuple literals: `{...}`
- Function literals: `fn ... => ...` and generic `fn[T] ... => ...`
- Quick functions: `'chain`
- Control-flow nodes in expression position
- `break` and `return`
- Data-tag application: `#tag`, plus removal via `#-tag` or its `#-tag` alias
- Elements, element call syntax, niladic element names, and `:` modifiers
- Function annotations such as `@recursive fn ...`
- Element annotations such as `@@tupled foo`
- Whitespace-free runs of `OP` tokens, merged by `_operator_run()` into one
  `Symbol`; whitespace ends the run

Qualified element names are parsed by `_qualified_symbol`. Supported forms
include namespace qualification with dots, object-friendly qualification with
`::`, and the built-in escape namespace:

```text
utils.double
Foo::bar
*::+
*::Some
```

The token after `::` may be an identifier or operator. This is required for
built-in operator access such as `*::+`.

Keep `_term()` focused on choosing a syntactic form. Put nested parsing in
helper methods such as `_record_fields`, `_dict_entries`, or
`_modifier_arguments`.

### Variable, index, and member paths

Variable paths are parsed as one source-level path and then lowered into ordinary
read/update nodes. A path may mix indexing, ordinary fields, and optional-safe
fields:

```text
$value[0].child->leaf->name
$->child->leaf
```

`FieldAccessNode` and `FieldSetNode` carry `optional_safe=True` for `->`; the
same nodes with the flag unset represent `.`. Chaining is not represented by a
special AST node. The parser emits the accesses in source order.

For assignment, `_variable_path_read` emits the reads needed to reach the leaf,
and `_variable_path_rebuild` emits the inverse updates from the leaf back to the
root variable. This is how a source assignment such as:

```text
$instructions[$i].jump = $open
```

becomes an immutable nested update. Keep safe and ordinary field kinds distinct
through both halves of that lowering. Safe assignment is currently supported
for a named optional root such as `$person->age = 37`; a `None` receiver cancels
the write at runtime.

The stack spelling `$->field` has no leading variable node. It still supports a
full member chain, for example `$->a->b->c`.

### Record literals and row types

Record and dictionary entries use `=>`. Every field, key, and value expression is isolated on its own empty stack. Records use the ordinary row postfix: `record(.cmd: String, .jump: Int)`. The removed bracketed record type spelling is a parse error.

### Control-chain ordering

A control-flow node at the right edge of a chain must receive values computed by
the elements to its left. For example, `parseInt match => ...` lowers as
`parseInt` followed by `match`, not the normal all-element reversal. The special
case in `_lower_chain_segment` preserves that data-flow boundary. Add parser and
runtime tests whenever changing this rule; a parse-only snapshot can look valid
while matching the wrong stack value.

### Extracting match cases

A match case may begin with `extract` before its comma-separated patterns. The parser records this on `MatchCaseNode.extract`; it does not rewrite the pattern tree. Literal strings retain ordinary literal-pattern syntax, with analysis/code generation interpreting them as regular expressions only for extracting cases.

### Adjacency-sensitive syntax

Because ordinary cursor movement skips whitespace, syntax that requires touching
tokens must check source adjacency explicitly. Consecutive tokens are treated as
one construct only when `_adjacent(first, second)` succeeds.

Current adjacency-sensitive cases include:

- `_operator_run()`, which merges only a whitespace-free run of `OP` tokens into
  one element symbol. For example, (`+`+`+` -> `++`), while `+ +` remains two
  symbols.
- `_match_ellipsis()`, where all three `.` tokens must be adjacent. `...` is an
  ellipsis; `. . .` is not.
- The `||` branch in `_match_pattern()`, where the two pipe tokens must touch.
- Rank continuation in `_type_postfix()`, where repeated rank operator tokens are
  counted only while each next token is adjacent to the previous one.

When adding another multi-token spelling, first decide whether whitespace may split
it. If not, use `_adjacent` for every consecutive pair rather than relying on
`_peek()` alone.

## Blocks

Most block forms use:

```text
keyword condition? => body end?
```

`_body(stop_words=None)` chooses between single-line and multiline bodies:

- If the token after `=>` is not `NEWLINE`, the body is a single chain ending at
  a line terminator or structural terminator. A trailing `end` is consumed when
  present.
- If the token after `=>` is `NEWLINE`, the body is a sequence of statements
  until `end` or another supplied stop word such as `else`.

This means single-line forms like this should parse without getting stuck:

```text
fn => + | double end
```

Be careful when adding stop words. `_at_terminator` accepts both token kinds and
identifier strings, so stop words such as `"end"` and `"else"` work even though
they are `IDENT` tokens.

## Delimited Expressions

The parser has two related helpers:

```python
_comma_expressions(closer)
_argument_expressions(closer)
```

`_comma_expressions` parses zero or more comma-separated chain expressions.
It is used for collection and tuple literals where empty forms can be valid.

`_argument_expressions` rejects empty argument lists. This enforces the language
rule that niladic elements must be recognizable without context: use `\nilad`,
not `nilad()`. Variable function-call syntax is different because the leading
`$` proves a function value is being called, so `$f()` is valid and parses as an
empty `call`.

Examples:

```text
[]                 # empty list literal parses
$f()               # empty variable function call parses
foo()              # syntax error
define foo() => 1  # syntax error
fn () => 1         # empty function literal parameter list parses
```

Use `_argument_expressions` for element call syntax where empty parentheses
would create ambiguity. Use `_comma_expressions` for syntactically unambiguous
empty argument lists such as variable function calls, and `_params(allow_empty=True)`
for function literals.

## Element generic arguments and overload disambiguation

Element suffixes have separate, fixed meanings and are parsed in this order:

```text
element[generic arguments]{overload parameter hints}(call arguments): modifier
```

Square brackets bind declaration generics by position. An underscore leaves a
position for inference. Adjacent curly braces provide positional parameter-type
hints to overload selection and do not bind generics. For example,
`convert[Int, _]{Number}(1)` explicitly binds the first generic, infers the
second, and asks overload selection to treat the first call parameter as
`Number`.

The generic and disambiguation suffixes must touch the element token. In
particular, `map{Number}` is an element disambiguation, while `map {Number}`
contains a normal tuple literal. Curly braces avoid conflicting with symbolic
`<` and `>` element names and with function element-tag lists.

## Function-Argument Modifier

The `:` modifier binds function arguments directly to the element node:

```text
[1, 2, 3, 4] map: double
```

parses as:

```text
ListLiteral(...)
ElementNode(name=map, modifier_args=(FunctionNode(body=(ElementNode(double),)),))
```

Multiple function arguments use parenthesized comma-separated chains:

```text
fork: (sum, length) /
```

The parser wraps each modifier chain in a `FunctionNode` and stores those
functions in `ElementNode.modifier_args`. A modifier may follow an ECS call, so
`map([1, 2, 3]): * 2` stores both `call_args` and `modifier_args` on the same
`ElementNode`. When the modifier expression is already exactly one explicit
`FunctionNode`, as in `map([1, 2, 3]): fn => * 2 end`, preserve that function
instead of wrapping it in a second function. Do not emit modifier functions as
ordinary preceding stack values; the analyser matches bound modifier functions
to function-typed parameters by overload.

### Negative operator shorthand

The modifier parser treats an adjacent signed number after `:` as a stack
operation when the operator has a compatible scalar overload. Therefore
`apply: -1` means a function that subtracts one from its input. A constant
negative function must be explicit: `apply(fn => -1)`. This distinction belongs
in modifier parsing rather than in the `apply` element.

## ECS Call Arguments And Optional Defaults

Adjacent `foo(...)` syntax parses as an `ElementNode` with structured
`call_args`, not as ordinary expression nodes inserted into the surrounding
chain.

- Positional ECS arguments store `CallArgument(value=...)`.
- Named ECS arguments such as `foo(bar = 1)` store `CallArgument(name=bar, ...)`.
- `_` placeholders store `CallArgument(placeholder=True)` so later optional ECS
  arguments can skip earlier positions.

This structure matters because optional defaults are an ECS-only feature. The
parser should preserve which arguments were named, positional, or placeholders
instead of flattening them into normal stack expressions.

During analysis, positional ECS arguments for named elements align with the
rightmost unbound non-modifier parameters. This makes `left element(right)`
equivalent to `left right element`; a complete `element(first, second)` call
still fills the complete parameter list in declaration order. Named arguments
reserve their declared positions before positional alignment. Function-value
calls retain their placeholder-aware left-to-right binding. Every named element
uses the same ECS parameter-binding rule, regardless of what its implementation
does to the stack.

## Type Parser

`parse_type(source)` uses the same token stream but calls
`Parser.parse_type_expression()` and then requires EOF.

The type parser currently supports:

- Named types: `Number`, `String`, `Result[Number, String]`
- `None`
- Bare function type: `Function`, lowered to unknown-shape `T.Fn()`
- Function types: `Function[Number, String -> Number]`
- Parenthesized grouping: `(Number | String)`
- Tuple types: `{Number, String}`
- Arbitrary-length tuple parameter types: `{Number...}`,
  `{Number..., String}`, `{Number..., String...}`
- Union types: `A | B`
- Intersection types: `A & B`
- Anonymous generic variables: `@1`, `@2`, and so on
- Row-constrained types: `T(.bar: U)` and `T(.bar: U, .baz: String)`
- Optional types: `T?`, `T???`, `T?3`, lowered to nested `Some[T] | None`
- Atomic call-policy markers: `T atomic`, lowered to `Atomic(T)` and retained
  in callable parameter signatures while erased from body value types
- Exact parameter markers: `T exact`, lowered to `Exact(T)` and retained inside
  `Function[...]` parameter types
- List rank postfixes: `T+`, `T+3`, `T+$n`, `T*`, `T*3`, `T*$n`,
  `T~`, `T~3`, `T~$n`
- Contiguous repeated rank/optional markers count as numeric shorthand:
  `T++ == T+2`, `T*** == T*3`, `T~~~~ == T~4`, `T??? == T?3`
- Mixed rank postfixes are rejected unless the outer marker is a direct
  superset, such as `T+* == T**`. Optional postfixes are a barrier, so
  `T+?+` and `T+?*` are valid.
- Data-tagged types: `#sorted Number+`, `#-infinite Number+`
- Function element tags after function types:
  `Function[Number -> ]<Eager, !Panic[String]>`
- Anonymous structural traits:
  `trait[T] => extend +(:T, :T) -> T end`

Type parsing is split by precedence:

```text
_type_union
  -> _type_intersection
      -> _type_tagged
          -> _type_postfix
              -> _type_primary
```

When adding new type syntax, place it at the correct precedence layer. Do not
bolt it onto `_type_primary` if it is actually a prefix, postfix, union-like, or
intersection-like form.

Row constraints are postfix types. After parsing the base type, `_type_postfix`
recognizes a parenthesized list whose first meaningful token is `.` and lowers
each `.name: Type` entry through `Row(...)` and `Field(...)`. Looking for the
leading dot is required because match type patterns independently use
`Type(pattern, ...)` syntax.

`exact` is a terminal postfix for one type expression. It disables
vectorisation through a function parameter, so the parser keeps it as an outer
`ExactType` wrapper and does not consume later rank or optional postfixes as
part of the same type. Consequently, write `T+ exact`, `T? exact`, or
`#tag T exact`; forms that try to add another type postfix after `exact` are
invalid.

Arbitrary-length tuple types are only valid while parsing parameter types. The
parser uses an internal "allow variadic tuple type" flag around function and
trait parameter parsing. Do not allow `{T...}` in return types, casts,
disambiguation hints, object fields, or standalone `parse_type(...)` unless the
language restriction changes.

Bare `Function` is intentionally different from `Function[ -> ]`. The former is
an unknown-shape callable and triggers call-site type checking when it appears in
an overload parameter. The latter is a concrete niladic function type.

Element tags on function types are parsed after the `Function[...]` shape using
angle brackets. `!Tag` records a required tag absence. Tag arguments reuse
ordinary type parsing, so `Panic[String]` stores `String` as a type argument
rather than as text.

Tuple ellipsis is parsed after each tuple item, not as a postfix type operator.
This lets `{A..., B, C...}` lower to a single variadic tuple pattern with mixed
fixed and repeated segments. The three dots must be pairwise adjacent; whitespace
breaks the ellipsis.

## Generic Parameter Lists

Object-like declarations and function definitions parse generic parameter lists
before the declaration name. Function literals parse them immediately after
`fn`:

```valiance
define[T] keep(value: Vehicle[T]) -> T => ...
object[T] Box => ...
trait[T] Readable => ...
variant[E] Result => ...
enum[T] Option => ...
fn[T] (value: T) -> T => $value
```

The parser records generic names on `ObjectNode`, `DefineNode`, and
`FunctionNode`. Generic parameter lists may also carry bounds:

```valiance
define[T: Vehicle] keep(value: T) -> T => $value
define[T: any Vehicle] keepSubtype(value: T) -> T => $value
define[T: above Car] keepSupertype(value: T) -> T => $value
```

Unlabelled bounds behave like `any`: the solved type must be assignable to the
bound. `above` reverses that relationship: the bound must be assignable to the
solved type. The parser stores the optional label in the generic variance slot
and the bound in the matching generic constraint slot; the analyser interprets
the pair when building overload constraints and declaration-site variance.

This declaration-local generic syntax is separate from ordinary type parsing:
outside a declaration's generic list, bare `T` is parsed as a nominal type name.
The analyser rewrites names that match the surrounding declaration's generic
parameters into type variables before storing object attributes, constructors,
function definitions, function literals, and requirements.

Function declarations may also carry element tags after the parameter list and
before the return arrow:

```valiance
define log(value: String)<IO> -> () => print(value)
eager define show(value: String) -> () => println(value)
```

The `eager define` spelling records the same parsed function node with the
`Eager` element tag attached.

Element-tag declarations use the same `tag` statement without a leading `#`:

```valiance
tag Log as property
tag Eager as companion
tag Read disjoint Write
```

Disjoint declarations may also cross between data and element tags in either
order:

```valiance
tag #infinite disjoint Eager
tag Eager disjoint #infinite
```

The parser records whether a function tag list was explicitly written. It also
records compiler-authorized companion tags separately, so `eager define` can
attach `Eager` while an ordinary `define ...<Eager>` or `fn<Eager>` is rejected
during analysis.

Only `define` parameter lists may currently attach trailing `= <expr>` defaults.
Those defaults are recorded on `FunctionParam.default` for later ECS lowering;
they do not change ordinary stack-call arity.

## Data Tags

Data tags are tokenized by the lexer as a single `OP` token starting with `#`.
The parser converts them with `_tag_from_token`.

Supported forms:

```text
#sorted
#-infinite
#tag+
#tag++
#tag+3
```

A tag in expression position becomes `TagApplicationNode`. A tag before a type
becomes a `Tagged(...)` type.

`#-tag` represents tag removal or absence, depending on whether it appears in
expression or type position. The parser only records the syntax. Analysis
decides what it means for the current stack/type context.

## Adding An AST Node

Parser-facing AST work usually touches several files:

1. Add the dataclass to `src/valiance/asts/nodes.py`.
2. Export it from `src/valiance/asts/__init__.py`.
3. Parse it in `src/valiance/parsing/parser.py`.
4. Add display support in `src/valiance/asts/pretty.py` if useful for
   debugging.
5. Add parser tests in `tests/test_parser.py`.
6. Coordinate with `analysis-type-system-guide.md` and `runtime-codegen-guide.md`
   for later stages if the node should analyse or compile.

Prefer immutable dataclasses consistent with existing nodes:

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class NewNode(ASTNode):
    values: tuple[ASTNode, ...] = ()
```

Use tuples, not lists, in AST fields. Lists are fine as temporary parser
accumulators.

## Adding Syntax

A good syntax-change workflow:

1. Read the relevant section of `docs/language.md`.
2. Decide whether the lexer needs a new token boundary.
3. Add or adjust tokens in `lexer.py`.
4. Add parser support in the smallest relevant method.
5. Preserve chain lowering by returning the right `_ChainPiece` flags.
6. Attach locations to all new AST nodes.
7. Add focused tests in `tests/test_parser.py`.
8. Run parser tests and then the full test suite.

Use these commands:

```powershell
$env:UV_CACHE_DIR="$PWD\.uv-cache"; uv run python -m unittest tests.test_parser -v
$env:UV_CACHE_DIR="$PWD\.uv-cache"; uv run python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
$env:UV_CACHE_DIR="$PWD\.uv-cache"; uv run ruff check .
```

## Common Pitfalls

Do not lose stack order.

If a syntax form participates in a chain, think carefully about whether it is an
element, a nilad, or a chain breaker. A wrong `breaks_chain` or `is_element`
flag often produces an AST that looks plausible but executes backwards.

Do not use `foo()` for nilads.

Empty argument and parameter lists are intentionally syntax errors. Niladic
elements need source-level context independence, so they use backslash-prefixed
names such as `\foo`.

Do not treat `|` as type union everywhere.

The lexer emits one pipe token. In expression parsing it is a chain separator.
In type parsing it is a union operator. Keep that distinction local to parser
mode.

Do not make modifier arguments ordinary stack nodes.

`element: chain` is bound to the element, because the analyser needs to match
function arguments to function-typed parameters independent of ordinary stack
argument order.

Do not silently accept empty call syntax.

Use `_argument_expressions`, not `_comma_expressions`, for element calls,
variable calls, annotation arguments, and other places where empty parentheses
would imply niladic behavior.

Do not give annotations parser semantics.

The parser records `AnnotationNode` values on declarations, function literals,
and annotated element nodes. Validation and behavior belong in
`analysis/contracts/annotations.py` so built-in annotations and future compiler-plugin
annotations use the same extension point.


Do not infer adjacency from whitespace-skipping lookahead.

`_peek()` intentionally hides `WHITESPACE`, so seeing two punctuation tokens in
successive lookahead positions does not prove that they touched in source. Use
`_adjacent` for operator runs, ellipses, `||`, rank continuation, and any future
whitespace-sensitive multi-token spelling.

Do not merge operators in the lexer.

`_operator()` must emit one `OP` token per character with correct offsets. Emitting
growing substrings creates overlapping duplicate tokens and prevents the parser
from making reliable adjacency decisions. Operator-symbol merging belongs in
`_operator_run()`.

Do not forget source locations.

Diagnostics rely on locations. If a new node is parser-created and may be
analysed, compiled, or shown to the user, give it a location.

## Parser support boundaries

The parser guide describes syntax accepted by the current implementation.
Confirm edge cases against `tests/test_parser.py` before changing grammar or
chain lowering. Native bindings use `link`, and value conversion uses
`@convert` declarations with target-directed `to[Type]` calls.

### Unicode identifiers

The lexer implements the UAX #31 identifier profile with `XID_Start` and
`XID_Continue`, extending the start set with `_`. Python's Unicode identifier
predicates provide the versioned XID tables. Identifier token values are NFC
normalized immediately; `Token.raw` retains the source spelling so adjacency and
source spans continue to use the original width. The lexer explicitly rejects
Unicode categories `Cc`, `Cf`, `Co`, and `Cs`. Symbolic operators remain governed
by `_OP_CHARS` and are intentionally unchanged. Unicode helpers live beside the
lexer in `src/valiance/parsing/unicode_identifiers.py`.

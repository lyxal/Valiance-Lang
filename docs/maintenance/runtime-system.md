# Understanding Valiance's runtime and code generator

This is the human-first guide to Valiance code generation, bytecode, and the
virtual machine. It is written for maintainers who understand the broad idea of
a compiler and a stack machine but do not yet feel confident following a typed
node all the way to a runtime value.

The most important reassurance is this:

> The runtime is not a second analyser. Code generation records the decisions
> analysis already made, and the VM carries out that recorded plan.

Most runtime complexity comes from a small interpreter supporting several
language features at once: stack functions, explicit parameters, overloads,
closures, vectorisation, lazy lists, objects, panics, tags, and lifecycle rules.
Each mechanism is understandable once its boundary is separated from the
others.

Use this guide before the exhaustive
[runtime and code-generation reference](../Compiler%20Documentation/runtime-codegen-guide.md).
The reference is the detailed implementation contract. This guide explains the
mental model, the main APIs, and how to debug the pipeline without treating the
VM as a black box.

## How to use this guide

You do not need to read it all at once.

- For the first mental model, read **The sixty-second model**, **The bytecode
  data model**, and **One VM frame at a time**.
- For a wrong-result or wrong-stack bug, read **How code generation lowers typed
  nodes**, **The physical and conceptual stacks**, and **Tracing one program**.
- For overload or vectorisation bugs, read **Resolved calls**, **Authorised
  runtime dispatch**, and **Runtime vectorisation**.
- For object, closure, or cleanup bugs, read **Runtime values and ownership**.
- For saved-bytecode problems, read **Serialization is a compatibility
  boundary**.
- For implementation work, keep **The API decision table**, **Fault isolation**,
  and **A final mental checklist** nearby.

## The sixty-second model

A normal run has five runtime-facing stages:

```text
typed AST
   |
   | code generation
   v
unoptimised Program(FunctionCode(...))
   |
   | default OptimizationPipeline (optional)
   v
Program(FunctionCode(...))
   |
   | optional dumps(...) / loads(...)
   v
portable bytecode representation
   |
   | VirtualMachine.run(...)
   v
final Valiance stack and side effects
```

The analyser has already decided:

- which element overload won;
- the order in which explicit or named arguments map to parameters;
- whether a call vectorises;
- how deeply each argument vectorises;
- static rank values and hidden numeric `where` results;
- whether runtime union or multimethod dispatch is permitted;
- return tags and known collection ranks; and
- which object-friendly or external element implementation is selected.

Code generation converts those decisions into explicit records and opcodes. The
VM should not infer them again.

At runtime, the VM repeatedly performs one simple step:

```text
instruction = code.instructions[ip]
execute instruction against the current frame
advance or replace ip
```

A frame contains a physical value stack, locals, globals, input-cycling state,
panic handlers, and ownership bookkeeping. The VM stores resumable `_Activation`
records in an explicit Python list. User-function calls push an activation and
returns pop it, so Valiance recursion does not consume Python recursion depth.
A cached direct-leaf check lets functions containing only ownership-trivial
resolved built-ins execute without entering the scheduler; any function that may
call user code still uses the activation stack.

Explicit `return` instructions may carry a site-specific result count. The VM
keeps that many topmost values before unwinding the frame; `RETURN_SIGNAL` uses
the same selection before propagating through loop helper frames. Bare returns
fall back to the enclosing `FunctionCode.return_count`.

Typed function returns are not an open-ended snapshot of the frame stack.
Code generation records the analyser-selected return multiplicity on
`FunctionCode`. At `RETURN`, the VM keeps exactly that many topmost values and
releases any lower temporary values. Consequently, ordinary inferred functions
return one value when analysis finds a non-empty final stack and zero values when
analysis finds an empty final stack; explicit multi-return signatures and
`@returnAll` retain their analysed multiplicity. The top-level `<main>` frame
continues to expose its complete final stack.

The runtime still performs genuinely dynamic work where values matter:

- reading and writing concrete values;
- following jumps;
- constructing objects and collections;
- checking a checked cast;
- matching runtime patterns;
- selecting a branch from an analyser-produced union dispatch plan;
- selecting a `multi` specialisation when the typed call authorises it;
- traversing eager or lazy lists according to a compiled vectorisation plan;
- handling panics; and
- retaining, releasing, and cleaning up runtime values.

A useful rule is:

```text
If the answer depends only on types or source structure, analysis/codegen owns it.
If the answer depends on the concrete runtime value, the VM may own it.
```

## A map of the implementation

### `runtime/bytecode.py`: the execution vocabulary

This module defines immutable records used between code generation,
serialization, and execution:

- `OpCode`
- `Instruction`
- `ResolvedElementReference`
- `FunctionCode`
- `FunctionSetCode`
- constructor and vector-extension references
- `Program`

These records describe an execution plan. They contain almost no execution
policy.

### `runtime/compiler.py`: typed AST to bytecode

`compile_program(...)` accepts only analysed `TypedNode` values. `_Compiler`
walks those nodes, emits instructions, compiles nested functions, and patches
jump targets.

This file should translate decisions, not invent new semantic ones. When
compiler code needs to ask a type question that analysis should already have
answered, first check whether a typed-node field is missing.

### `runtime/optimizer.py`: extensible bytecode rewrites

`compile_program(...)` runs `DEFAULT_OPTIMIZATION_PIPELINE` after lowering unless
`optimize=False` is supplied. `OptimizationPipeline` applies ordered whole-program
passes. `FunctionOptimizationPass` supplies recursive traversal for function-local
passes across every nested code payload.

The default sequence materialises safe scalar cycle inputs, folds pure constants,
inlines small constant nilads, folds again, applies bytecode peepholes, simplifies
physical stack shuffles, and finally cleans up control flow. Rewrites share one
range replacement utility that refuses to delete the interior of a branch target
and retargets every absolute branch and panic-handler address.

Keep optimisation separate from lowering and execution. A pass may simplify an
already explicit bytecode plan, but it must not redo overload selection, type
inference, or other analyser work. Argument materialisation is limited to cases
where the bytecode and selected built-in metadata prove exactly which parameters
would be cycled; ambiguous or lifecycle-bearing cases stay implicit. Add a new
pass by implementing `OptimizationPass` and placing it in a pipeline; do not grow
one monolithic optimiser switch.

### `runtime/vm.py`: bytecode execution

`VirtualMachine` owns:

- runtime globals;
- frame creation;
- the instruction loop;
- function and built-in calls;
- runtime-authorised dispatch;
- vectorisation;
- panic handling;
- indexing and field operations;
- match execution;
- object lifecycle and ownership; and
- runtime diagnostics.

The file is large because it contains many operations, but the central loop is
still a straightforward opcode dispatch.

### `runtime/serialization.py`: portable bytecode

This module converts `Program` records to and from a versioned binary format. It
owns the byte representation, value tags, opcode numbers, validation, and the
magic/version marker.

First-class FFI scalars use a dedicated tagged value encoding. Their canonical
`&`-prefixed type spelling and primitive payload are both serialized, so a
round trip cannot erase FFI identity or reinterpret the payload as an ordinary
Valiance primitive.

### `runtime_values.py`: shared value semantics

This module defines values used by both the VM and built-ins:

- `LazyList` and `ListValue`;
- `TaggedValue`;
- `FFIScalarValue`, an immutable scalar with exact `&Type` runtime identity;
- `ObjectValue` and `ObjectRuntimeType`;
- `PanicSignal`;
- list/rank helpers; and
- user-visible formatting.

Putting these rules in one place keeps `println`, diagnostics, built-ins, and
the VM from disagreeing about what a value is.

### `analysis/builtins.py`: shared static/runtime built-ins

A built-in declaration pairs a static `Overload` with a Python runtime
implementation. `RuntimeContext` gives implementations controlled access to
output, callable invocation, formatting, selected overload invocation, and
static values recorded by codegen, including hidden numeric results from
`where` clauses and other compile-time constants that need to reach runtime.

There is deliberately one built-in registry rather than separate analyser and
VM registries.

Built-in execution is one scheduler-atomic region from entry until return or
fault. Scheduler fairness is not a `RuntimeContext` service, and built-ins must
not enter the scheduler. Cancellation requested during a built-in remains
pending; after a successful return the VM observes it before the next ordinary
user-visible instruction. A built-in fault remains primary when cancellation is
also pending. Explicit VM operations own suspension, while cleanup, ownership
transfer, and other partially committed native operations remain atomic. Future
long-running resumable work must use explicit VM machinery rather than adding
polling callbacks to `RuntimeContext`.

### `stdlib_native.py`: Python-backed imported functions

Native standard-library functions use the same runtime implementation shape as
built-ins, but they remain module-qualified and importable. The analyser sees a
typed wrapper; the VM sees a qualified `BuiltinElement` in its runtime globals.

## The bytecode data model

### `Instruction` is an opcode plus a payload

```python
Instruction(OpCode.PUSH_CONST, Decimal("5"))
Instruction(OpCode.LOAD_VAR, "x")
Instruction(OpCode.JUMP_IF_FALSE, 17)
```

The payload is deliberately generic at the dataclass level because different
opcodes need different records. The compiler, serializer, and VM together define
the payload contract for each opcode.

When adding or changing an opcode, update all three places and add a round-trip
test. An in-memory execution test cannot prove the serializer understands the
new payload.

### `FunctionCode` is the unit of execution

A `FunctionCode` contains:

- an instruction tuple;
- the exact analysed return count for typed functions;
- runtime parameter names;
- an optional diagnostic name;
- whether explicit parameters participate in input cycling;
- element tags;
- recursion and `multi` flags;
- nominal runtime dispatch hints;
- declared return data tags; and
- declared exact return collection ranks.

The top-level program is also a `FunctionCode`, named `<main>`, wrapped in a
`Program`.

### `FunctionSetCode` preserves overload bodies

A source definition may analyse to several overload bodies. Codegen compiles
each one to `FunctionCode` and stores them in `FunctionSetCode`.

The set may also contain a `dispatch_plan`. That plan does not ask the VM to
solve overloads. It tells the VM which already-selected overload index belongs
to each reified runtime branch of a union input.

### References carry structured payloads

Complex instructions use named dataclasses rather than positional tuples. For
example, `ResolvedElementReference` carries:

- `name`: runtime lookup name;
- `overload_index`: selected slot;
- `vectorised`: whether to map rather than call once;
- `vectorised_depths`: per-argument recursive mapping depth;
- `vectorised_target_ranks`: exact runtime rank boundaries;
- `return_collection_ranks`: rank evidence to reattach;
- `type_args`: concrete generic object/variant arguments;
- `static_values`: hidden values such as solved rank variables, `where`
  results, or call-site-selected callable group arities;
- `arity_override` and `consumed_override`: call-site checked stack contracts;
- `multidispatch`: permission to select a `multi` specialisation; and
- `extension`: compiled unequal-length vector extension behaviour.

Named fields matter because this record crosses compiler, serializer, and VM
boundaries. A positional tuple would be easy to misread and hard to evolve.

Call-site checked built-ins can attach `runtime_static_values` to their concrete
applied overload. Codegen copies those values into `ResolvedElementReference`,
and the VM exposes them through `RuntimeContext.static_values`. This is the
correct way to preserve an analysis-only partition decision such as
`sequence` choosing an `n`-argument lower group and an `m`-argument upper
group, or a `where` clause computing a hidden numeric constant; the runtime
must not rediscover those values from an overloaded callable.

## How code generation lowers typed nodes

`compile_program(nodes)` first verifies that every node is typed. It then calls
`_Compiler.compile_function(...)` for the top-level body and, by default, runs
the resulting `Program` through `DEFAULT_OPTIMIZATION_PIPELINE`. Pass
`optimize=False` when the exact direct code-generator output is required.

The compiler is mostly a large pattern match in `_Compiler.node(...)`:

```text
NumberLiteralNode       -> PUSH_CONST
GetVariableNode         -> LOAD_VAR
SetVariableNode         -> STORE_VAR
FunctionNode            -> MAKE_FUNCTION
ListLiteralNode         -> item code, then BUILD_LIST
FieldAccessNode         -> GET_FIELD
IfNode                  -> condition, jumps, patched targets
TypedElementNode        -> usually CALL_RESOLVED_ELEMENT
```

That direct relationship is the easiest way to read codegen: find the AST node,
then inspect the emitted opcode sequence.

### Compilation is recursive

Nested source functions become nested `FunctionCode` or `FunctionSetCode`
objects stored inside `MAKE_FUNCTION`, constructor, loop, unfold, guard, or
extension payloads.

The VM materialises those code records into closures only when execution reaches
the instruction.

### Emission and patching

Forward jump targets are not known when the first instruction is emitted.
Codegen therefore uses a simple patching pattern:

```python
jump_to_else = emit(JUMP_IF_FALSE, None)
compile_then_branch()
jump_to_end = emit(JUMP, None)
patch(jump_to_else, current_instruction_index())
compile_else_branch()
patch(jump_to_end, current_instruction_index())
```

`if`, `assert`, `match`, `try`, `while`, and `break` all use variations of this
mechanism.

The compiler is not building a control-flow graph. It emits a linear instruction
stream and fills in integer instruction pointers.

### Typed metadata changes lowering

The raw AST says that an element was written. The typed wrapper says what that
call means.

Examples:

- `TypedElementNode.overload_index` chooses a runtime slot.
- `call_arg_order` causes a `STACK_SHUFFLE` before the call.
- `AppliedOverload.vectorised_depths` are copied to the resolved reference.
- a typed `?` call becomes `TRY_UNWRAP`, because it must return from the current
  frame rather than merely invoke a built-in function;
- `TypedAtNode` becomes a function value plus a resolved `call` carrying stop
  ranks and the analysed body-overload index; and
- typed literal items are compiled instead of their raw equivalents so nested
  constructor type arguments are not lost; and
- `TypedMatchNode` and `TypedForNode` retain analysed child bodies so resolved
  calls inside cases and loop bodies remain `CALL_RESOLVED_ELEMENT` operations.

Control-flow bodies can produce different analysis branches. The analyser keeps
child metadata only when every surviving branch agrees on the typed suffix; it
otherwise falls back to raw child nodes. This conservative fallback preserves
correctness while preventing stable recursive and loop bodies from repeating
runtime overload search on every execution.

When a codegen bug appears, compare the typed node to the emitted instruction.
The compiler should be a faithful projection of that data.

### Function metadata is compiled once

For each analysed overload, `_compile_function_overload(...)` records:

- parameter names, including hidden static parameters;
- whether it is `multi`;
- dispatch type names;
- return tags; and
- return ranks.

`Program.tag_parents` records variant-to-computed-parent relationships once for
runtime use. At each function boundary, the VM removes undeclared tag evidence,
reapplies declared return tags, and retains a runtime variant only when its
computed parent is declared on that return. This keeps runtime evidence aligned
with the static contract without erasing a variant that the function established.

This lets runtime invocation remain mechanical. The VM does not reopen the AST
or call the type solver.

## Resolved calls are the main compiler-VM contract

The normal source element path is:

```text
TypedElementNode
  -> ResolvedElementReference
  -> CALL_RESOLVED_ELEMENT
  -> direct runtime slot invocation
```

The VM loads `reference.name`, examines what kind of runtime value it names, and
uses `reference.overload_index` directly.

For a built-in, the slot indexes `BuiltinElement.definitions`.

For a user-defined overload set, the slot indexes
`OverloadedFunctionValue.overloads`.

For a constructor, the slot selects the initializer overload and `type_args`
are attached to the new `ObjectValue`.

This is the practical meaning of “overload resolution is static”: the VM is
given an address inside the selected runtime definition.

### Dynamic `CALL` is a different operation

When codegen does not have a statically resolved element reference, it emits:

```text
LOAD_ELEMENT name
CALL
```

`CALL` pops a callable value from the stack and dispatches by runtime callable
kind:

- `BuiltinValue`;
- `FunctionValue`;
- `ObjectConstructorValue`; or
- a single-overload `OverloadedFunctionValue`.

A multi-overload function without a resolved slot is rejected on this path. That
prevents the VM from silently inventing an ordinary overload choice.

Dynamic calls are needed for first-class function values and some generated
wrappers. They are not the preferred lowering for an ordinary analysed element
call.

### `RuntimeContext.call` is the controlled callback path

Built-ins such as mapping, folding, and optional chaining need to call function
values supplied as arguments. `RuntimeContext` exposes:

- `call(value, args)`;
- `call_overload(value, args, index)`;
- output;
- formatting; and
- `static_values`.

`VirtualMachine.call_value(...)` handles first-class callable values. It may use
an analyser-produced union dispatch plan, an exact runtime dispatch signature,
or vectorisation where the callable value itself is the dynamic input.

This path should not be confused with source element resolution. It exists
because a built-in has received an actual callable value and must invoke it.

## Authorised runtime dispatch

A blanket rule that “the VM never dispatches” would be too strong. It performs
three narrow kinds of dispatch whose permission and search space are compiled
in advance.

### Static union dispatch plans

When analysis adapts an overload set to a union-typed callable, it emits
`UnionDispatchBranch` records. Each record contains runtime type patterns and one
overload index.

The VM matches concrete arguments against those patterns and calls the recorded
index. It does not rank overloads or choose a more specific return type.

### Multimethod dispatch

A resolved call may set `multidispatch=True`. The selected slot is the analysed
fallback, and the VM may replace it with a compatible `multi` specialisation
whose runtime object types match.

Without that flag, no multimethod search occurs.

### Runtime checks inside a selected implementation

Some facts cannot be represented by a static signature, such as whether a list
is non-empty or which value case a result object currently holds. A selected
built-in may inspect those facts.

That is validation or value-case behaviour, not overload resolution.

## One VM activation at a time

`VirtualMachine.call(...)` creates a root `_Activation` containing a `_Frame` and
an instruction pointer. `_drive_frames(...)` repeatedly runs the top activation
until it returns or requests another user-function call. Every function still
has its own physical stack, but nested calls are represented by activation
records instead of nested Python `execute()` calls.

A frame contains:

| Field | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `stack` | Physical runtime values produced inside this frame |
| `locals` | Parameters, local assignments, and isolated captures |
| `globals` | Built-ins, stdlib hooks, definitions, and captured environment |
| `cycle_values` | Explicit input values available to stack-style body operations |
| `cycle_index` | Next cyclic input position |
| `cycle_stack_remaining` | Initial conceptual inputs not yet consumed |
| `panic_handlers` | Active try-handler targets and protected stack depths |
| `cycle_scopes` | Saved input-cycling state for nested match/cycle scopes |
| `retained_locals` | Locals whose ownership must be released with the frame |

A call does not hand the caller's list object to the callee as a shared stack.
The callee executes independently and returns its final stack as a list of
results.

### Functions that accept proved caller-stack inputs

Most function calls remain isolated. A call-site checked body can be compiled
with `FunctionCode.accepts_stack_inputs` when analysis has proved that its
concrete callable argument requires an additional suffix from the caller stack.
User-defined `dip` is the canonical case. The VM transfers only the statically
calculated number of values; this is not an open-ended shared-stack mode.

`FunctionCode.param_collection_ranks` records exact parameter ranks when known.
Together with `accepts_stack_inputs`, this metadata affects argument sourcing and
therefore belongs to the serialized bytecode compatibility boundary.

### Parameters have two runtime views

Explicit parameters are available as named locals:

```valiance
define addFive(x: Number) => $x + 5
```

They are also available to stack-style operations through the conceptual input
cycle:

```valiance
define double(:Number) => +
```

The second body needs two operands even though the function has one input. The
input value is initially available once, then cycles, so `+` receives the same
value twice.

This dual view is why `FunctionCode` has `cycle_params` and `_Frame` has cycle
state. It is a runtime implementation of Valiance's stack-function semantics,
not runtime type inference.

## The physical and conceptual stacks

Match branches follow the same distinction. A selected branch begins with an empty physical stack. Ordinary retained subjects or `extract` captures are installed as conceptual cycle inputs and are sourced only if the body underflows. A body that only pushes a literal therefore returns only that literal, regardless of how many match inputs were available.


`_Frame.source_args(arity)` is the central argument-sourcing operation.

It considers three sources, in order:

1. values already on the physical frame stack;
2. initial explicit input values that have not yet been conceptually consumed;
3. cyclic reuse of explicit input values when more operands are required.

It returns:

```text
(arguments,
 number_of_physical_stack_values_consumed,
 next_cycle_index,
 next_cycle_stack_remaining)
```

The caller commits those bookkeeping values only after sourcing succeeds.

This API prevents every opcode and call helper from reimplementing parameter
cycling. It also preserves argument order: the right side of the Python list is
the top of the Valiance stack, while `_pop_many` and `source_args` return values
in the left-to-right parameter order expected by implementations.

Explicit parameters form that conceptual stack in declaration order, so the
last declared parameter is initially on top. Underflow sourcing therefore pops
parameters from right to left and wraps back to the last parameter. For
`(a, b, c)`, four consecutive unary operations source `c`, `b`, `a`, then `c`.
When one operation needs several arguments, the popped values are restored to
normal lower-to-upper argument order before the selected implementation runs.

### What input cycling should not do

Input cycling should supply values for an already known arity. It should not:

- decide which overload applies;
- reorder named arguments;
- guess a missing variable binding;
- infer vectorisation depths; or
- search an arbitrary number of inputs.

Those are static decisions. If a VM bug seems to require cycling changes, first
inspect the compiled arity, selected overload, and typed argument order.

## Closures and globals

`MAKE_FUNCTION` calls `_make_function_value(...)`. The resulting closure stores:

- its `FunctionCode`;
- a snapshot-like globals dictionary containing visible globals and locals;
- the names of captured locals whose ownership it retains; and
- a reference count.

Each invocation isolates captured local values into frame locals. Assigning to a
captured name during one call does not mutate the closure's captured template for
future calls.

Recursive code binds `this` to the closure. Named definitions are also rebound
when stored so self-reference works after assignment.

At top level, `STORE_VAR` publishes definitions into VM globals so later
instructions and retained REPL state can find them. Closures created directly in
the main frame read those bindings as globals rather than retaining a second
lexical-local ownership copy. Nested functions still isolate genuine enclosing
function locals on every call, so assignments to captured locals preserve their
existing non-persistent call semantics.

## The interpreter loop is a small state machine

`VirtualMachine.execute(...)` creates the root activation. `_run_activation(...)`
repeatedly matches on its current opcode until the activation returns or suspends
at a user-function call. The caller's instruction pointer and pending call are
stored on `_Activation`, so the driver can resume it without a Python call stack.

Most opcodes fall into a few families.

### Stack and name operations

- `PUSH_CONST`
- `LOAD_VAR`
- `LOAD_VAR_MATERIALIZE`
- `LOAD_VAR_BORROW`
- `STORE_VAR`
- `LOAD_ELEMENT`
- `POP`
- `STACK_SHUFFLE`
- `SOURCE_ARGS`

These move values while applying retain/release rules. `LOAD_VAR_BORROW` is
emitted for the root variable of a field or indexed assignment that stores back
to the same binding, and for variable-rooted access chains consumed directly by
`print` or `println`. It places a non-owning access wrapper on the stack. Field
reads preserve that wrapper without retaining or releasing the object receiver,
and the observational built-in unwraps it immediately before formatting. The
wrapper cannot enter persistent storage through this lowering, while ordinary
reads continue to use `LOAD_VAR` and materialise an additional occurrence. A
direct variable-to-variable assignment uses `LOAD_VAR_MATERIALIZE` with both
source and destination names. Literal construction uses the same instruction
with aggregate context for list and tuple elements, record fields, and dictionary
entries. Known invalid storage is rejected by the analyser; generic or otherwise
uncertain storage retains this instruction as a runtime backstop, and any
`DuplicationFault` identifies the materialisation destination. Closure creation
also supplies capture context when retaining lexical locals, so an indirect
capture failure names the captured variable.
Plain
immutable scalar values and containers already classified as ownership-trivial
take a direct stack path because they cannot own runtime resources. Closures,
objects, tagged payloads, lazy values, and containers with lifecycle-bearing
contents still use the full ownership helpers. Frame cleanup iterates locals
once and clears the map after releases rather than snapshotting and deleting
every entry.

### Construction operations

- `MAKE_FUNCTION`
- `BUILD_LIST`
- `BUILD_STRING`
- `BUILD_TUPLE`
- `BUILD_RECORD`
- `BUILD_DICT`
- `MAKE_OBJECT_CONSTRUCTOR`
- `MAKE_ENUM_MEMBER`

Collection builders pop a known count and construct one value. `BUILD_LIST` may
also attach an analysed exact runtime rank.

### Access and update operations

- `GET_FIELD` / `SET_FIELD`
- `GET_INDEX` / `SET_INDEX`
- `CHECK_CAST`
- `TRY_CAST`
- `VALIDATE_TAG`

Checked casts, tag validation, missing keys, invalid indexes, and other concrete
value failures happen here or in shared helpers.

Field opcode payloads retain whether the source used ordinary `.` or optional-safe
`->`. Safe reads unwrap `Some`, propagate `None`, flatten already-optional fields,
and vectorise over list-shaped receivers. Safe writes reconstruct the wrapped
payload and return `None` unchanged when the write is cancelled. Deep or mixed
chains are just consecutive field operations; each operation keeps its own flag.

### Function occurrence effects

`FunctionCode.occurrence_effects` records the input provenance of each selected
return. An integer identifies the parameter whose occurrence is forwarded;
`None` means the output is fresh or its provenance cannot yet be proven. The
compiler currently proves the exact one-parameter, one-result forwarding form
and lowers its terminal parameter read to `LOAD_VAR_FORWARD`. That opcode removes
the parameter from the completed frame's locals and places the same occurrence
on the result stack, so frame cleanup cannot release it or force a duplicate.
Generic identity functions therefore preserve unduplicatable values without a
special type rule. Other bodies remain conservative and continue through the
ordinary runtime duplication boundaries when they store, capture, or multiply
values. Occurrence effects are serialized as part of the bytecode function
contract and are available to prepared-call optimization.

### Calls

- `CALL`
- `CALL_RESOLVED_ELEMENT`
- `TRY_UNWRAP`

`TRY_UNWRAP` is a call-like primitive with frame-level control flow. It unwraps
`OK`/`Some`, but returns the current function immediately for `None` or an
error-like value.

### Control flow

- `JUMP`
- `JUMP_IF_FALSE`
- `JUMP_IF_MATCH`
- `MATCH_ERROR`
- `WHILE`
- `FOREACH`
- `UNFOLD`
- cycle and break operations
- try/panic operations
- `RETURN` / `RETURN_SIGNAL`

A jump changes `ip` and continues without the normal increment. A return moves
the frame stack out, releases frame-owned locals, and hands the result to the
caller.

### Error context is attached at the instruction boundary

If an opcode raises a Python runtime exception, `execute(...)` wraps or enriches
it with:

- function name;
- instruction pointer;
- instruction; and
- a stack snapshot.

Call helpers additionally attach target and argument information. Preserve that
layering when adding errors; a message without execution context is much harder
to debug.

## Control flow is jumps plus small runtime signals

### `if` and simple `while`

These compile to ordinary conditional and unconditional jumps. There is no
separate runtime AST evaluator.

### `match`

Codegen serializes patterns into compact tuple-like pattern specs and emits
`JUMP_IF_MATCH` targets. The VM checks concrete values, creates bindings, and
enters a cycle scope for the matched values.

The analyser remains responsible for type checking and static exhaustiveness
rules. `MATCH_ERROR` protects runtime integrity when no emitted case matches.

### `foreach`, parameterised loops, and return propagation

Nested loop bodies compile as `FunctionCode`. Internal exceptions `_LoopBreak`
and `_FunctionReturn` carry values across the nested Python call boundary.
They are VM implementation signals, not user-visible faults.

### Panics

A Valiance panic is carried internally by `PanicSignal(value)`.

`TRY_BEGIN` pushes a handler table and records the current stack depth. When a
panic reaches `_handle_panic(...)`, the VM:

1. scans active handlers from innermost outward;
2. checks the concrete panic value against each handler type;
3. releases stack values produced after the protected depth; and
4. jumps to the selected handler target.

If no handler matches, the signal leaves the frame. `VirtualMachine.run(...)`
converts an uncaught signal into a user-facing `RuntimeError`.

A panic is intentionally separate from a VM implementation error. A language
program may catch a panic value; it should not catch corrupt bytecode or an
invalid instruction payload.

## Runtime vectorisation executes a static plan

Automatic vectorisation begins in analysis. `AppliedOverload` records whether
mapping is needed and how each argument participates. Codegen copies that plan
to `ResolvedElementReference`.

The VM then performs traversal, because only runtime knows the concrete list
objects and lengths.

### Per-argument depths

A depth of zero means “broadcast this argument unchanged.” A positive depth
means “index one collection level, decrement the depth, and continue.”

This is more precise than “vectorise every list argument.” An exact-list
parameter may intentionally receive a whole list while another argument maps
over its items.

### Target ranks

A parameter may require mapping until an argument reaches an exact collection
rank. `vectorised_target_ranks` lets the VM calculate the needed runtime depth
from reified rank evidence without consuming a lazy list merely to inspect its
shape.

### Eager and lazy paths

Eager sequences can be indexed and have known lengths. The VM checks length
compatibility, recurses by index, and transposes multiple scalar return positions
into multiple result lists.

Lazy lists are advanced by iterators. Deferred vectorisation returns a
`LazyList`, so the scalar operation may execute later. Lazy vectorisation must
produce one value per item because a lazy stream cannot represent several
independent stack-result streams with the current value model.

### Unequal-length `extend`

A compiled vector extension may contain exactly one strategy:

- a default value/function;
- presence-pattern rules; or
- a selector receiving `Some`/`None` values.

Codegen embeds nested function code in `VectorExtensionReference`. The VM
materialises closures after sourcing the call arguments, fills missing vector
positions, and retains extension-owned values when the result is lazy.

### `at` uses the ordinary resolved-call machinery

`TypedAtNode` is lowered to a body closure and a resolved `call` instruction.
The level stop ranks become vectorisation target metadata. Named `at` levels are
normal function parameters; implicit bodies consume the same parameters through
input cycling.

This is a good example of keeping one mechanism: `at` does not require a second
VM iteration language.

## Runtime values and ownership

The VM uses reference-count-style ownership for values that may hold resources,
captures, deferred work, or nested values.

### Value categories

- Python immutable primitives such as `Decimal` and `str` need no explicit
  ownership action.
- `ListValue` is a reference-counted eager list with optional exact rank
  evidence and a cached classification for lists whose direct items require no
  ownership traversal.
- `DictValue` is the corresponding reference-counted eager mapping/record
  wrapper; it caches the same direct-value ownership classification and
  invalidates it on mutation.
- `LazyList` stores an iterable, retained owners, and a reference count.
- `TaggedValue` wraps a payload with reified data-tag evidence.
- `ObjectValue` stores nominal name, fields, generic type arguments, lifecycle
  metadata, and ownership state.
- `FunctionValue` stores code, captures, owned capture names, and a reference
  count.
- `OverloadedFunctionValue` owns its component closures.

### Wrappers that embed arguments

A fresh result can own references that were previously call arguments. `Some` and
`OK` wrappers, records, lists, tuples, and dictionaries may all embed object
values. Before releasing call arguments, result finalization recursively retains
embedded arguments that survive inside a new result. Missing this step produces a
wrapper whose payload has already been destroyed.

### Retain and release

Loading, copying, capturing, returning, consuming, and dropping values call
`_retain_runtime_reference(...)` or `_release_value(...)` as appropriate.

Containers recursively retain or release contained values. Tagged values defer
to their payload. Lazy results retain their input owners so deferred iteration
does not observe destroyed captures.

Stack operations are therefore not merely Python `append` and `pop`. A semantic
copy may increase ownership; a consumed stack tail must release its values.
The VM first checks whether a consumed tail contains any ownership-bearing value
and skips the recursive release walk for scalar-only tails. `ListValue` and
`DictValue` also carry container reference counts. Ordinary loads increment the
count; releases decrement it and traverse children only when the final owner is
dropped. Borrowed assignment receivers do not increment the count. A uniquely
owned, ownership-trivial container can therefore be updated in place, while an
aliased container is cloned and the original remains unchanged. The cached
direct-item/value classification is invalidated after Python-side mutation and
preserved when a clone only installs scalar replacements. Large numeric buffers
and scalar records therefore avoid both recursive ownership walks and repeated
whole-container copies. Return-tag and collection-rank attachment similarly
return immediately when the analysed metadata is empty. These are performance
fast paths, not changes to ownership or value semantics.

### Object duplication, destruction, and must-call rules

Language-level duplication and runtime reference maintenance use separate VM
entry points. Static assignment, explicit `dup`, and stack-transformation checks
use one `_duplication_requirement(...)` query, which returns a definite
rejection, definite permission, or the need for a runtime check. Unions require
every alternative to permit duplication; any known noncopyable alternative makes
the union noncopyable until source code narrows it with a cast or pattern match.
Intersections are also rejected when any constituent is known to be noncopyable.
Runtime fallback is reserved for unresolved type variables or other genuinely
unknown evidence, not known mixed unions. Stack shuffles count additional occurrences per
labelled input: `copy` includes its preserved prestack occurrence, while `move`
counts only its requested poststack outputs. Explicit `dup` lowers to the same
checked `copy` stack transformation used by the runtime, avoiding a second
object-friendly overload decision after analysis.

`_duplicate_occurrence(...)` first validates the complete value
without changing any reference counts, then delegates to `_retain_runtime_reference(...)`.
The latter only maintains runtime references and must not be called by an
operation that establishes an independently usable language occurrence. This
keeps a failed recursive duplication atomic and prevents internal reference
counts from defining the language's duplication semantics. Explicit `dup`,
`copy` outputs, multiplicity-increasing `move` outputs, variable loads, captures,
and other existing occurrence-producing paths use `_duplicate_occurrence(...)`.

The duplication implementation maintains these invariants:

1. `_retain_runtime_reference(...)` only maintains VM references and never
   decides whether a language occurrence may be created.
2. `_duplicate_occurrence(...)` preflights the complete nested value before any
   reference count changes, so failure cannot partially retain an aggregate.
3. `LOAD_VAR_BORROW` never enters persistent storage.
4. `LOAD_VAR_MATERIALIZE` always carries an operation, source, and destination;
   obsolete unstructured payloads are not accepted by the current bytecode.
5. `LOAD_VAR_FORWARD` removes its source parameter from frame locals before the
   result escapes the frame.
6. Serialized occurrence effects must match the declared return count and may
   reference only valid parameter indexes.
7. Stack-shuffle duplication is counted per labelled input and tested across
   zero through multiple requested outputs for both `copy` and `move`.

`ObjectRuntimeType` may describe:

- a `~Type` destructor element;
- duplication behaviour or a duplication fault;
- `mustcall` mode; and
- required method names.

`pop` itself is not customizable. It releases one reference, and only a release
that reaches zero begins destruction. The VM then:

1. snapshots whether the ordinary-lifetime `@mustcall` contract was satisfied;
2. invokes the `~Type` destructor, if present;
3. marks the object destroyed and releases its fields regardless of destructor
   success; and
4. propagates the destructor panic or reports `MustCallFault` according to the
   lifecycle fault-precedence rules.

Destructors may panic and retain the inferred `Panic[...]` effect from their
bodies. A destructor panic propagates normally outside unwinding. The VM keeps an
explicit stack of panics whose propagation is currently releasing frame values;
this state is entered before failed frames, pending callees, and their owned
values are discarded. Cleanup remains scheduler-atomic, so another cooperative
task cannot observe or overwrite that state during a release walk.

A destructor panic while that unwind stack is non-empty raises the non-catchable
`DoublePanicAbort`. The diagnostic retains the original panic, the destructor
panic, and the type being destroyed. A second destructor panic in one ordinary
teardown cascade follows the same fatal path, with the first cleanup panic treated
as the original. Calls made while the receiver is being destroyed cannot satisfy
`@mustcall`. The contract is snapshotted before `~Type` starts, and every
successful-call marking path also rejects receivers that are destroying or
already destroyed.

A lone must-call violation during panic unwinding is attached to the active
`PanicSignal` as secondary context and does not replace it or trigger double
panic. Outside unwinding, `MustCallFault` remains an ordinary catchable panic
after destruction. A real destructor panic stays primary over the contractual
fault.

### Destructor effects are part of static function effects

After an object's friendly definitions are analysed, the environment records the
positive element tags inferred for its `~Type` overload. `Environment.destructor_effects(...)`
projects those effects through nominal generic arguments, unions, fixed tuples,
collections, and transparent type wrappers.

Function signature construction includes the destructor effects of owned values
visible at function exit. Consequently, accepting or locally owning a `File`
whose destructor carries `Panic[IOFault]` conservatively gives the function the
same `Panic[IOFault]` effect. Explicit absent-effect contracts such as `<!Panic>`
are checked against these implicit final-release effects in the ordinary tag
validation path.

This first implementation is deliberately conservative: a visible owned
parameter contributes its destructor effects even when a returned alias may keep
the allocation alive. Later ownership-flow refinement may move that potential
release outward, but must never omit an effect from a release that can be final.

### Lifecycle ownership

The lifecycle sequence now uses one release-effect model for function exit,
single and parallel replacement, field and index reconstruction, and explicit
stack discard. Return transfer is provenance-backed for both explicit returns
and implicit multi-value stack results. Direct variable reads transfer the named
occurrence; computed values remain conservative. Runtime destruction continues
to preserve primary-fault precedence, secondary diagnostics, nested cleanup
context, and fatal double-panic behavior.

Future lifecycle changes should be treated as independent bug fixes or language
features rather than extensions to this patch sequence.

### Returned values transfer ownership out of scope

Function-exit effect inference transfers ownership only when a return expression
is a direct read of a named variable. The exact variable name is removed from the
release set, so returning the sole owned value does not inherit its destructor
effect. Type equality alone is deliberately insufficient: a separately produced
value of the same type cannot suppress cleanup of a local. Explicit and implicit
direct returns retain this provenance; computed returns remain conservative.

### Release-site effects are centralized

`analysis/contracts/release_effects.py` defines ownership dispositions and the
single operation used to turn a released type into destructor element tags.
Borrowed, transferred, and retained occurrences add no release effect; released
and unknown occurrences conservatively inherit the type's destructor effects.

The analyser now invokes this operation at single and parallel replacement
assignment, field and index reconstruction, explicit `pop_n` stack discard, and
function-exit cleanup. Parallel assignment snapshots every old target type before
performing any write, so release effects are independent of target order.
Replacement accounts for the old stored type before writing the new occurrence,
while `pop_n` accounts for the exact sourced stack values. Reconstruction
accounts for the overwritten field or indexed item while ownership of the
reconstructed receiver continues in the returned replacement. This
makes effects properties of release operations rather than incidental
appearances of destructible types.

### Lifecycle diagnostics retain structured cleanup context

Every destructor panic, field-cleanup failure, and runtime `MustCallFault` receives
a deterministic `cleanup_context` entry naming the logical object being
destroyed. Primary failures retain ordered `secondary_faults`; the VM boundary
renders those as `secondary lifecycle diagnostic` blocks rather than leaving the
structured information accessible only to embedding code. Nested field cleanup
adds both inner and outer destruction contexts while preserving catch behavior.

Double-panic diagnostics remain fatal and continue to render original panic,
cleanup panic, and the object whose teardown exposed the conflict.

### Object fields release in reverse declaration order

Object constructor metadata carries an explicit tuple of field names in source
declaration order. Final cleanup never relies on dictionary iteration order. It
releases declared fields in reverse order after `~Type` completes, then releases
any runtime-only compatibility fields in reverse insertion order. This mirrors
stack-like acquisition and teardown.

The field-order tuple is included in runtime metadata, survives bytecode
serialization, and is available to optimized and unoptimized execution alike.
The VM still supports legacy metadata without an explicit field order, where it
uses reverse runtime insertion order as a compatibility fallback.

### Destructor receiver escapes are rejected statically

`analysis/contracts/destructor_borrows.py` gives destructor `$self` and every
local alias derived from it a borrowed capability. Lifecycle validation rejects
statically recognizable ownership escapes before the destructor overload is
published: returning the receiver, embedding it in an aggregate, capturing it in
a closure, duplicating it, transferring it to a task, or sending it through a
channel. Reassignment removes the capability when an alias is overwritten with a
non-borrowed value. Ordinary field reads and non-escaping cleanup method calls are
permitted.

The checker is deliberately bounded to definite syntax-level escapes. Runtime
borrow enforcement from Patch 9 remains the mandatory backstop for dynamic or
indirect behavior.

### Destructor receivers cannot survive teardown

A destructor overload must have zero normal return values. An explicit return
signature is rejected during lifecycle validation, and an inferred non-empty
return is rejected after body analysis. A body that always panics is valid because
its `Never` result has no normal return path.

At runtime the VM exposes one explicit non-owning receiver borrow for `~Type`
after the external reference count reaches zero. The wrapper remains at reference
count zero throughout destructor execution. Ordinary `$self` loads and cleanup
calls can use the borrow, dropping it is a no-op, and any attempt to retain it is
rejected. Mandatory teardown ends the borrow and marks the wrapper destroyed
before field release. Every later retain or release reports a lifecycle integrity
error, so user code cannot resurrect or repeatedly release the object.

### Reconstructed wrappers share protocol identity

Visible object updates preserve immutable value semantics by constructing a new
`ObjectValue` wrapper. Protocol state cannot live directly on each wrapper,
because an old alias and a reconstructed result may still represent one logical
resource. `ObjectLifecycleState` therefore owns the mutable `mustcall_called` set,
and every reconstruction of the same logical object shares that state object.

The ordinary field-reconstruction path copies `lifecycle_state` by identity.
Successful object-friendly calls also make every same-typed object result adopt
the receiver's lifecycle state. Satisfying a contract through either an old alias
or a reconstructed wrapper is consequently visible to every related wrapper.
Reference counts, destruction guards, and field storage remain wrapper-local.

### Static must-call proof covers definite local lifetimes

Parameterized functions used by the flow pass obey the ordinary naming rule:
a leading `\` denotes a nilad and is rejected when the definition declares any
parameters. This validation occurs before overload publication or body analysis.


The analyser runs a conservative path-sensitive `@mustcall` pass over ordinary
function bodies after their types are established. It creates obligations only
for direct construction of known must-call object types, then tracks local aliases
by allocation token. Required calls through any tracked alias update the shared
obligation.

`if` branches are analysed independently, so every destruction path must satisfy
the contract. `try` bodies and handlers, zero-or-one representative loop paths,
and early returns are also considered. Returning a tracked allocation transfers
the unresolved obligation to the caller instead of diagnosing local destruction.

The pass intentionally diagnoses only provable local violations. Values entering
through parameters, dynamic containers, generic erasure, and other uncertain
ownership shapes remain governed by the runtime `MustCallFault` backstop.

### Visible updates use ownership-aware copy-on-write

Field and indexed assignments still have value semantics. Code generation marks
only the assignment receiver as borrowed, and the VM mutates a `ListValue` or
`DictValue` in place only when its reference count proves it is uniquely owned
and its direct ownership metadata is trivial. Shared containers are copied before
the update, so aliases continue to observe the old value. Object values and
lifecycle-bearing container contents retain the conservative reconstruction
path. Generic type arguments, runtime rank evidence, ownership metadata, and
lifecycle state must be preserved by every clone.

When adding a runtime value form, check:

- retain/release;
- formatting;
- runtime type naming;
- equality;
- indexing and field behaviour;
- tags and collection ranks; and
- whether it can appear in bytecode constants.

## Built-ins are scalar stack-fragment functions

A runtime built-in implementation has the shape:

```python
def implementation(
    args: tuple[Any, ...],
    ctx: RuntimeContext,
) -> tuple[Any, ...]:
    ...
```

Arguments are already in parameter order. The result tuple is the stack
fragment to push. No result is `()`, not `None`.

Scalar arithmetic built-ins should remain scalar. Vectorisation wraps the
selected implementation outside the built-in.

A built-in should check only facts the static signature cannot guarantee. For
example, a list parameter need not recheck “is this list-like?” when the resolved
signature proves it, but `head` must still check non-emptiness.

Built-ins that return one of their input objects interact with ownership helpers;
they should not manually increment runtime reference counts.

`BuiltinValue` caches its arity-sorted dynamic candidates, and each
`BuiltinOverload` caches runtime return-tag deltas plus whether its parameter and
return types are ownership-trivial. Resolved call sites additionally cache the
validated built-in/overload pair while guarding against local shadowing or a
replaced global. Do not move these decisions back into the per-call path.

Decimal arithmetic first uses the active context when it is already sufficient
for an exact result, then expands precision and exponent bounds only when
needed. Any faster arithmetic path must retain the arbitrary-precision tests; a
small-number benchmark is not permission to round large integers silently.

## Serialization is a compatibility boundary

`dumps(program)` writes:

1. the magic/version marker `VLNCBC\x15`;
2. the top-level `FunctionCode` and all nested instruction payloads; and
3. program-level variant-to-parent tag metadata.

Dynamic `CALL` instructions may contain a tuple of recursive return-tag
contracts. This payload is part of the compatibility boundary: older runtimes
that ignore it can leave static and runtime tag evidence inconsistent.

The format uses:

- fixed opcode bytes;
- big-endian length and integer fields;
- tagged values for constants and reference records;
- distinct generic encodings for Boolean and integer values;
- explicit strings and tuples; and
- validation while reading, writing, and before direct VM execution.

It intentionally does not use pickle, Python `repr`, enum names, or arbitrary
object serialization.

### Why the magic must change

If an old reader would interpret new bytes incorrectly, bump the magic/version.
Examples include:

- changing a function field order;
- changing an opcode payload layout;
- assigning a different meaning to an existing opcode byte; or
- adding an unmarked required field to a reference record.

Adding a new opcode also requires a stable byte number in `_OP_TO_BYTE` and a
reader mapping in `_BYTE_TO_OP`.

### Positional overload slots are part of current bytecode behaviour

Resolved calls serialize an overload index. Reordering built-in overload
registration can therefore change the meaning of existing bytecode even if the
source signatures are unchanged.

Treat overload order as compatibility-sensitive until the format uses stable
explicit overload identifiers.

### Round-trip testing is mandatory

For a bytecode-affecting feature, test:

```python
restored = loads(dumps(compile_program(typed)))
result = run(restored)
```

This protects against the common failure where in-memory dataclasses work but
the binary reader silently loses one field.

## Tracing one program end to end

Consider:

```valiance
define addFive(x: Number) => $x + 5
10 | addFive | println
```

After analysis, the body contains typed variable, literal, and element nodes.
The `+`, `addFive`, and `println` calls already carry selected overload slots.

Codegen produces a top-level shape like:

```text
0 MAKE_FUNCTION FunctionCode(name="addFive", params=("x",), ...)
1 STORE_VAR "addFive"
2 PUSH_CONST 10
3 CALL_RESOLVED_ELEMENT name="addFive", overload_index=<selected>
4 CALL_RESOLVED_ELEMENT name="println", overload_index=<selected>
5 RETURN
```

The nested function code is approximately:

```text
0 LOAD_VAR "x"
1 PUSH_CONST 5
2 CALL_RESOLVED_ELEMENT name="+", overload_index=<selected>
3 RETURN
```

Execution proceeds as follows:

1. `MAKE_FUNCTION` captures the current environment in a `FunctionValue`.
2. `STORE_VAR` binds it globally as `addFive`.
3. `PUSH_CONST` places `10` on the main frame stack.
4. The resolved call loads `addFive`, sources one argument, and creates a new
   frame with local `x = 10`.
5. The nested frame loads `x`, pushes `5`, and invokes the selected scalar `+`
   built-in directly.
6. The nested `RETURN` produces `[15]`.
7. The caller extends its stack with `15`.
8. The resolved `println` call consumes `15`, writes output, and returns `()`.
9. The main `RETURN` yields an empty final stack.

Nothing in those steps asks “which `+` overload matches?” The analyser answered
that before bytecode existed.

## A Python scratchpad for inspecting bytecode

A small recursive printer is often more useful than reading dataclass `repr`
output:

```python
from valiance.analysis import Analyser
from valiance.parsing import parse
from valiance.runtime import compile_program, dumps, loads, run
from valiance.runtime.bytecode import FunctionCode, FunctionSetCode


def show_code(code: FunctionCode, indent: str = "") -> None:
    print(f"{indent}function {code.name!r} params={code.params}")
    for index, instruction in enumerate(code.instructions):
        print(f"{indent}{index:04} {instruction.op.name:<24} {instruction.arg!r}")
        nested = instruction.arg
        if isinstance(nested, FunctionCode):
            show_code(nested, indent + "    ")
        elif isinstance(nested, FunctionSetCode):
            for overload in nested.overloads:
                show_code(overload, indent + "    ")


source = """
define addFive(x: Number) => $x + 5
10 | addFive
"""

analyser = Analyser()
typed = analyser.analyse(parse(source))
assert not analyser.diagnostics

program = compile_program(typed)
show_code(program.main)

restored = loads(dumps(program))
assert run(restored) == [15]
```

`Decimal("15")` compares equal in the repository's tests as a numeric runtime
value; print it directly when you need to distinguish Python representation from
Valiance formatting.

For a typed-call bug, print the `TypedElementNode` before compiling and the
`ResolvedElementReference` after compiling. That usually reveals exactly where
metadata was lost.

## The API decision table

| You need to... | Use or inspect... | Do not... |

## Fault isolation: find the first wrong stage

When execution is wrong, do not start by editing the VM. Inspect the pipeline in
order.

### 1. Typed AST

Check:

- selected overload index;
- argument order;
- actual returns;
- vectorised flag, depths, and target ranks;
- runtime consumed count;
- static rank values;
- `multidispatch`; and
- constructor type arguments.

If these are wrong, the bug is in analysis or type relations.

### 2. Bytecode

Check:

- opcode sequence;
- nested function bodies;
- jump targets;
- `FunctionCode.params` and `cycle_params`;
- `ResolvedElementReference`; and
- return tags/ranks.

If typed metadata is correct but absent or changed here, the bug is codegen.

### 3. Serialization

Compare the in-memory program with `loads(dumps(program))`. Dataclass equality is
useful here because the bytecode records are immutable structural values.

If only the restored program fails, the bug is in reader/writer symmetry or the
format version.

### 4. VM frame before the failing instruction

Inspect:

- physical stack;
- locals;
- cycle values/index/remaining initial inputs;
- instruction pointer;
- active panic handlers; and
- the resolved reference payload.

A stack-order bug is often visible immediately.

### 5. Runtime helper

Only after the prior stages agree should you inspect value-specific code such as
indexing, pattern matching, vector traversal, or cleanup.

## Common misconceptions

### “Bytecode is just a serialized AST.”

It is an execution plan. It contains jumps, selected overload slots, hidden
static values, compiled nested functions, and runtime metadata that raw syntax
does not contain.

### “The VM owns overload resolution.”

Ordinary overload choice is static. The VM performs only explicitly authorised
dispatch with a compiled plan or flag.

### “The Python list in a frame is the whole Valiance input stack.”

It is the physical stack produced in that frame. Explicit inputs also live in
the conceptual cycle state.

### “Parameter cycling searches for values until something works.”

It supplies a known arity from a known input tuple. It does not search types or
overloads.

### “Every list argument should vectorise.”

Depth zero broadcasts. Exact collection parameters may remain whole while other
arguments vectorise.

### “A built-in returns one Python value.”

It returns a tuple representing zero or more Valiance stack outputs.

### “Python exceptions and Valiance panics are the same.”

`PanicSignal` is a catchable language control signal. VM integrity errors become
`RuntimeError` and carry execution context.

### “Saving bytecode is just calling pickle.”

The format is explicitly encoded for portability and validation.

### “Reference counting is an implementation detail I can ignore in a helper.”

A helper that copies, captures, consumes, or defers a value must preserve
ownership or cleanup behaviour will be wrong.

## Safe extension patterns

### Adding codegen for a new typed node

1. Decide what information analysis must attach.
2. Add or extend the typed-node payload first.
3. Define the minimal opcode sequence or structured reference.
4. Lower it in `_Compiler.node` or a focused helper.
5. Add an in-memory compile/execute test.
6. Add a serialization round-trip if the payload reaches bytecode.
7. Test the invalid nearby case at analyser or compiler level.

Do not store a raw AST node in bytecode and interpret it later.

### Adding an opcode

1. Add `OpCode` in `bytecode.py`.
2. Define a stable payload shape.
3. Emit it from codegen.
4. Execute it in the VM loop.
5. Assign a byte value and serialize its payload.
6. Validate the payload when reading.
7. Bump `MAGIC` if existing readers would misinterpret the stream.
8. Add compiler, VM, and round-trip tests.

### Adding runtime dispatch

1. Prove why static selection is insufficient.
2. Have analysis produce a finite dispatch plan or explicit permission flag.
3. Serialize that plan.
4. Make the VM select only within that plan.
5. Do not use body failure as a matching mechanism.
6. Test side-effecting bodies to ensure candidates are not speculatively run.

### Adding a runtime value

1. Define the shared value record in `runtime_values.py` when appropriate.
2. Add formatting and runtime type naming.
3. Decide list/rank and tag behaviour.
4. Add retain/release behaviour.
5. Add field/index/cast/pattern support where meaningful.
6. Decide whether constants of this type may be serialized.
7. Test cleanup and aliasing, not only equality.

## Tests by responsibility

### `tests/test_runtime.py`

Use for:

- emitted resolved calls;
- frame and stack behaviour;
- closures and recursion;
- built-ins and stdlib hooks;
- vectorisation and extensions;
- objects, fields, indexing, and cleanup;
- panics and matching; and
- end-to-end execution.

Many runtime tests also inspect the compiled instruction so they protect the
analysis-codegen-VM contract rather than only final output.

### `tests/test_bytecode_serialization.py`

Use for:

- every new payload record;
- nested function code;
- function sets and dispatch plans;
- flags and return metadata;
- malformed input validation; and
- version-sensitive changes.

### `tests/test_analyser.py`

Use when the desired runtime behaviour depends on a selected overload,
vectorisation plan, argument order, static values, or another typed decision.

### `tests/test_programs.py`

These protect fundamental language behaviour. Do not modify them as a shortcut
for a runtime change.

## Recommended reading order in the source

A productive first pass is:

1. `runtime/bytecode.py` — learn the records and opcodes.
2. `runtime/compiler.py`: `compile_program`, `_Compiler.compile_function`, and
   `_Compiler.node`.
3. `runtime/optimizer.py`: `OptimizationPipeline` and the default control-flow
   pass.

## A final mental checklist

When changing code generation or runtime behaviour, ask:

1. Did analysis already decide this fact?
2. Is the typed-node payload sufficient to preserve that decision?
3. What exact instruction or reference should represent it?
4. Does the callee need a new frame, a nested code object, or only a stack
   operation?
5. Are arguments coming from the physical stack, initial conceptual inputs, or
   cyclic inputs?
6. Is any runtime dispatch explicitly authorised by a compiled plan or flag?
7. Are vectorisation depths, target ranks, and return ranks preserved?
8. Does the operation retain, release, capture, consume, or defer a value?
9. Can a panic cross this boundary, and is it distinct from a VM error?
10. Does the serializer round-trip every new field?
11. Will old bytecode be misinterpreted, requiring a magic/version bump?
12. Is the failure tested at the earliest layer that can observe it?

The runtime is large because it implements many language features, not because
its core is mysterious. Follow the records: typed node, instruction, reference,
frame, value. At each boundary, verify that the earlier stage made the decision
and the later stage merely executes it.

### Prepared calls for repeated higher-order invocation

Higher-order built-ins should prepare fixed-shape callable arguments once before
entering a repeated loop. `RuntimeContext.prepare_call(callable, arity,
multiplicity)` returns an invocation closure that validates the fixed call shape,
uses direct-leaf execution when the compiled body proves that safe, and otherwise
falls back to the general callable path. Unary `map` and string mapping use
prepared unary calls, while `reduce` and `fold` use prepared binary calls. `filter` additionally uses the
predicate service so Boolean-only structural specialisations can avoid temporary
vectors and function frames.

Prepared execution may skip post-call return processing only when the compiled
return metadata is structurally plain. Tagged, collection-ranked, union,
intersection, and tuple contracts continue through the ordinary return-contract
path. This keeps the fast path an execution optimisation rather than a second
source of language semantics.

Prepared calls are represented by a runtime-only `PreparedCall` object with an
observable strategy name for structural tests and profiling. The current
strategies are `resolved-builtin`, `direct-leaf`, and `general`. Straight-line
wrappers whose operands are parameters or constants and whose final operation is
a pure ownership-trivial resolved built-in use `resolved-builtin`; this removes
the wrapper frame entirely. Plans are cached per function value and fixed
arity/multiplicity pair. Collection-valued arguments continue through the normal
vectorisation path.

Run `PYTHONPATH=src python -m tools.benchmark_higher_order --runs 5` to measure
execution-only medians for filter predicates, unary mapping, binary folding, and
niladic mapping. The benchmark compiles each workload once and constructs a fresh
VM for every measured execution.


Niladic scalar functions made only from `PUSH_CONST` instructions use the
`constant` prepared-call strategy when they have no effects or nontrivial return
contracts. Niladic `map` opts into preparation only for this strategy, avoiding
the overhead regression seen when ordinary niladic calls were routed through a
generic plan. Scalar unary identity functions similarly use an `identity` plan.
Both strategies preserve the ordinary fallback for tagged, collection-valued,
effectful, or lifecycle-bearing results.


### Fused lazy iterator plans

Pure list `map` and non-eager `filter` now produce `PlannedLazyList` values. A
plan stores its original source and an ordered tuple of map/filter stages rather
than nesting one generator inside another. Consecutive stages append to the same
plan, preserving source order and one evaluation per stage. `sum` recognizes a
planned list and drives all stages with one terminal loop. This fuses `map ->
sum`, `filter -> sum`, and mixed `map -> filter -> sum` pipelines while ordinary
iteration still exposes the same lazy list semantics. Runtime collection-tag
canonicalization preserves plans only for structurally plain item contracts;
tagged and otherwise nontrivial contracts retain the existing recursive path.

Prepared calls also support a conservative `straight-line` strategy for short
scalar stack programs made only from parameter loads, scalar constants, and pure
ownership-trivial resolved built-ins. The builder proves stack depth at every
operation and rejects cycling-dependent, vectorised, effectful, tagged,
lifecycle-bearing, or user-call instructions. This removes full VM frames for
small arithmetic mapper and reducer bodies containing several built-in calls.


### Generality boundary for higher-order optimisation

Prepared execution is intentionally shape-driven rather than element-name
driven. Every concrete callable first receives a reusable fixed
arity/multiplicity `PreparedCall`; the generic plan builders cover constants,
identities, single resolved built-ins, multi-operation straight-line scalar
programs, direct leaves, and the fully general fallback. Predicate execution uses
the same preparation path. The vector-membership recognizer is merely one
registered predicate specializer ahead of that path, not a requirement for fast
filtering. New elements automatically participate when their selected overloads
are pure, ownership-trivial resolved built-ins, while effectful, vectorised,
tagged, lifecycle-bearing, or user-calling operations retain the general VM
semantics.

`PlannedLazyList` likewise exposes generic `reduce_terminal` and
`count_terminal` operations. `sum` and `length` are current consumers, but future
terminals can fuse without adding a new list wrapper or a source-specific opcode.
Stack combinators (`peek`, `dip`, `fork`, `both`, and `sequence`) now prepare
their concrete callables using reified runtime arity and multiplicity, so future
callable implementations benefit from the same plan selection rather than from
combinator-specific fast paths.

Pipeline fusion is also extension-oriented. `LazyPipelineStage` is a generic
keep/value transformation rather than a closed switch over built-in element
names. Current `mapping(...)` and `filtering(...)` constructors are convenience
factories; future lazy elements can append their own stage with the same
`(keep, value)` contract, and future terminals can consume any plan through
`reduce_terminal(...)`. This prevents every new lazy element or terminal from
requiring a bespoke VM opcode or pairwise fusion rule.

### Prepared scalar kernels inside vectorisation

User-function vectorisation now prepares the scalar callable once before walking
any vector depth. Each scalar leaf invokes `PreparedCall.invoke_proven(...)`,
which omits repeated arity and multiplicity checks because analysis and the
vectorisation plan have already fixed both shapes. This is not restricted to a
particular function body: constant, identity, resolved-builtin, straight-line,
direct-leaf, and general strategies all participate. Explicit `call` also uses
the same prepared plan for statically selected non-vector leaf invocations, so a
callable reached through generic call syntax does not lose its prepared strategy.
Collection-valued leaves, extensions, dynamic target ranks, and overloaded
selection continue through the existing vectorisation machinery.

### Stateful lazy pipeline stages

`LazyPipelineStage` now builds fresh per-iterator operations. This lets future
lazy elements carry iterator-local state without sharing it between traversals.
The first stateful stage is `limiting(...)`, used by `take`. A planned
`map/filter/take/...` pipeline remains one source loop, stops immediately after
the requested output prefix, and a zero-length prefix does not pull the source at
all. Stage results carry both keep/drop and stop-after-item signals, so future
early-terminating stages can preserve ordering without bespoke generator nests.

Eager higher-order `map`, optional/Result continuation through `&`, and explicit
`call` now use the same prepared-call entrypoint as lazy map, filter, reduce, fold, and
stack combinators. This broadens optimisation coverage by callable shape rather
than by benchmark or element implementation.

### V9 general call, vector-kernel, and pipeline infrastructure

`PreparedCall` exposes `invoke0`, `invoke1`, and `invoke2` for hot fixed-arity
consumers, while `invoke_proven` remains available for arbitrary stack effects.
These methods bypass tuple packing and repeated shape checks only where analysis
or the surrounding higher-order element has already proved the call shape.

`ScalarKernel` is the vectorisation-facing scalar interface. User-function
vectorisation adapts any prepared strategy to this interface, including
constant, identity, resolved-builtin, straight-line, direct-leaf, and general
plans. The vector walker therefore depends on a stable arity/multiplicity kernel
rather than on the kind or spelling of the function being vectorised.

Lazy pipelines now support a generic `PipelineTerminal` state machine with
initial, consume, early-stop, and finish operations. Existing reducing terminals
and first-value termination use this shared protocol. `head` terminates planned
pipelines after the first produced value. Stateful `drop` joins `take` as a
composable stage with fresh iterator-local state, allowing map/filter/drop/take
pipelines to remain one source traversal.

`VirtualMachine(collect_optimization_stats=True)` enables debug-only counters for
prepared-plan creation, reuse, and selected strategies. Counters are absent by
default, so normal execution does not perform per-call instrumentation. Use the
snapshot to confirm broad optimisation coverage and detect unexpected general
fallbacks in benchmark or diagnostic tooling.

Rank-one eager user-function vectorisation now selects a dedicated scalar-kernel
loop after resolving vector depths once. Unary, binary zip, left-broadcast, and
right-broadcast shapes avoid recursive vector dispatch and validate vector
lengths once. Other arities use the same kernel interface with a generic eager
loop; nested ranks, lazy inputs, extensions, and dynamic shapes retain the full
vectorisation path.

### Prepared guarded-match dispatch

Pure scalar functions whose control flow is a source-ordered guarded `match` can
now receive a `match-dispatch` prepared plan. The plan compiles each guard's
small built-in stack program once, caches stable runtime overload selections by
argument shape, and invokes selected ownership-trivial built-ins directly. It
also prepares constant branch results and scalar string formatting without
creating guard or branch VM activations for every input item.

The recognizer is structural: it consumes `SOURCE_ARGS`, `JUMP_IF_MATCH`, guard
`FunctionCode`, branch targets, and the final return shape. It is not tied to
FizzBuzz, particular constants, or a range size. Guards or branch bodies outside
the proved subset retain the existing direct-leaf or general VM execution path.
Source-order semantics, wildcard fallback, vectorisation fallback, runtime type
matching, and return contracts remain unchanged.

The scalar/vector-membership predicate recognizer is stack-shape invariant for
equivalent needle placement. It accepts both a membership needle already below
the projected vector and a needle pushed after vector projection followed by the
corresponding shuffle. Recognition derives the argument, constant-list build,
vector operation, needle, reorder operations, and terminal membership call from
bytecode rather than requiring one source spelling. Paired benchmarks and tests
must remain within ordinary run-to-run variance and return identical predicates.

### V12 symbolic straight-line predicate plans

The dedicated scalar/vector-membership bytecode recognizer has been removed.
Predicate preparation now symbolically executes the supported straight-line
bytecode subset into an expression graph. Argument loads, constants,
compiler-generated literal temporaries, list construction, stack permutations,
resolved built-ins, and vectorised calls become semantic nodes rather than
instruction-position patterns. Equivalent prefix, postfix, and pipeline source
forms consequently produce equivalent graphs even when their bytecode order and
shuffle instructions differ.

The evaluator compiles pure resolved calls into reusable graph nodes. A generic
terminal-call rewrite can consume a rank-one symbolic vector call item by item
when the terminal compares or searches its projected result, avoiding temporary
vector materialisation. The rewrite is triggered by graph topology and resolved
call semantics, not source text, constant values, or instruction offsets.
Unsupported instructions, dynamic callables, effects, extensions, multidispatch,
or non-scalar output shapes reject symbolic preparation and retain the ordinary
VM path. The former membership-specific recognizer is intentionally absent so
new spellings cannot be addressed by accumulating more positional cases.

### Exact-rank collection arguments in prepared leaves

Prepared direct-leaf calls no longer equate every list-like argument with a
request for vectorisation. Before adapting a collection argument, the plan
compares its runtime collection rank with the function parameter's analysed
collection rank. An exact-rank argument is one scalar parameter value and enters
the leaf directly; only arguments above the accepted rank use collection
adaptation. This applies to arbitrary collection-accepting leaf functions and is
not specific to grids, neighborhoods, indexing, or cellular automata.

This distinction is especially important for higher-order mapping over nested
collections. A mapper accepting `T+` must receive each rank-one cell group once,
not recursively vectorise the mapper over every scalar inside that group. Rank-2
inputs to that same rank-1 parameter continue to vectorise normally. The tests
cover both sides of this boundary.

### V14 nested traversal and symbolic aggregate matches

Prepared calls now retain their analysed parameter collection ranks. `map` uses
those ranks to build one traversal plan for nested eager inputs: it descends only
the outer ranks and invokes the prepared callback at its declared stop rank.
This removes repeated rank discovery and vector-kernel selection while
preserving ordinary lazy rank-one map behaviour.

A new `symbolic-match` plan compiles pure expression prefixes followed by
source-ordered literal-pattern matches. Supported graph nodes include arguments,
constants, temporary locals, indexing, aggregate construction, resolved scalar
calls, and literal/wildcard aggregate patterns. Branches currently require
constant scalar results; unsupported patterns or effects retain the VM path.
The graph compiler performs escape-aware `sum(removeAt(collection, index))`
projection reduction without constructing the removed collection, and an
integral transient reduction may remain unboxed until its match consumer.
These transformations are based on graph topology rather than element names,
source spelling, dimensions, or literal values.

### Proven tag-free collection metadata

`ListValue` now carries invalidatable tag-freedom metadata alongside ownership
metadata. Native producers and rank-aware maps may prove a newly created tree is
tag-free. Runtime return-contract canonicalisation can then skip recursive walks
only when the static contract also declares no tags. Every mutating list method
invalidates the proof. Tagged contracts and collections without proof continue
through full recursive canonicalisation.

## Callable execution policy

Compiler-produced callables have a known invocation contract. The VM applies
that contract; it does not discover behavior by executing candidates.

`VirtualMachine.call_value` now follows these policies:

- collection arguments are scalar only when they satisfy the compiled
  `param_collection_ranks`; otherwise the callable is vectorised;
- vectorisation failures propagate directly and are never swallowed before a
  scalar retry;
- overloaded values use an analyser-produced union dispatch plan when present;
- declarations whose alternatives carry `dispatch_types` use those compiled
  types in specificity order;
- overload bodies are never tried speculatively to see which one succeeds.

The distinction is between a runtime-varying closure value and an unknown call
contract. A closure may vary, but its parameter ranks, overload alternatives,
and dispatch policy must already be represented in bytecode.

Optimization statistics expose the applied contract through:

- `call.policy.interface-scalar`
- `call.policy.interface-vectorised`
- `call.policy.fixed-scalar`
- `call.policy.fixed-vectorised`
- `call.policy.union-dispatch`
- `call.policy.declared-dispatch`

## Cooperative suspension and atomic built-ins

The initial concurrency runtime uses one executor. Scheduler suspension sources
therefore must never block the host thread. `Scheduler.register_timer` creates a
deterministic logical timer; `register_external` creates an explicit wake token
for integrated I/O or test doubles. Both return an exactly-once
`SuspensionRegistration`. Cancellation removes the registration once, firing
commits one wake once, and pending sources suppress deadlock classification.

External calls declare `ExternalCallPolicy`: immediate, scheduler-suspending, or
host-blocking. Host-blocking calls are rejected before concurrent execution.
Cancellation awareness is explicit metadata rather than inferred behavior.

Built-in calls are scheduler-atomic from entry until return or fault.
`RuntimeContext` does not expose scheduler fairness or polling, and built-ins
must not enter the scheduler. Pending cancellation is observed by the VM after a
successful built-in return and before the next ordinary instruction; a built-in
fault remains primary when cancellation is also pending. Large finite eager
operations may delay siblings by design. Retain/release, channel commit,
copy-on-write detach, assignment reconstruction, and destructor execution also
remain atomic. Potentially unbounded work must stay lazy, be explicitly bounded,
use an explicit VM suspension mechanism, or be rejected.

## Task-aware concurrency diagnostics

Concurrency bytecode carries stable source sites for scope entry, spawn, wait,
and channel operations. A failed task stores its task id, terminal state, spawn
site, owning-scope site, and underlying fault. Waiting does not replace that
fault: each observation adds only the current wait site, so repeated waits retain
fault identity while reporting the new observer.

The CLI and both REPL frontends use the shared exception renderer. It renders the
primary task context first, then deterministic secondary faults with their own
task contexts. Runtime wrapping preserves this metadata for panics, closure,
cancellation, deadlock, and invalid-runtime faults. Optimized and serialized
programs retain the same diagnostic structure.

Deadlock edges include task spawn sites and blocked-operation sites when known.
Timer and external wake registrations continue to suppress deadlock diagnosis
until no scheduler-visible wake source can make progress.

## Concurrency bytecode compatibility and optimizer barriers

The bytecode header is `VLNCBC` followed by the format-version byte. The current
format version is 30 (`0x1e`). A file with the expected prefix but another
version fails before payload decoding with an explicit received/expected version
message. Checked-in version 30 and unsupported version 29 concurrency fixtures
make this boundary reproducible.

Every concurrency opcode is an optimizer barrier: spawn, scalar and vector wait,
scope begin/end, channel construction/send/receive/close, and cancellation poll.
Before and after every optimization pass, the pipeline compares the ordered
barrier contract across the main function and all nested bytecode payloads. A
pass that changes barrier order, payload, or nesting is rejected with
`OptimizationError`. This protects capture boundaries, dynamic scope ownership,
wait effects, channel order, and task/channel identity without redesigning the
optimizer.

Function traversal includes ordinary nested functions, overloaded
`FunctionSetCode`, union-dispatch plans, vector extension functions, object
initializers, generic specializations represented as compiled functions, and
recursive functions. A function containing concurrency barriers is not an
inlining candidate.

## Deterministic concurrency fuzzing and replay

`python -m tools.concurrency_fuzz` runs scheduler/task/channel lifecycle cases
from independently derived per-case PRNG seeds. Campaign slicing does not change
a case: replay a failure with the reported `--seed`, `--start`,
`--iterations 1`, and `--operations` command. Failures include the generated
operation prefix and cause. CI runs 500 bounded cases; the nightly workflow runs
10,000 longer cases.

Runtime test instrumentation exposes monotonic task terminal-transition counts
and channel send/receive commit, cancellation, and fault counters. Fuzz and
stress gates assert one terminal transition, complete waiter cleanup, FIFO,
no duplicate receives, deterministic task outcomes, and empty runnable queues.
The generated mix exercises completion/cancellation, blocked send and receive,
close races, aliases and repeated observations. Dedicated contract tests retain
coverage for nested scope faults, group waits, mixed deadlocks, cyclic transfer,
and lazy cancellation.

## Concurrency stress and benchmark gates

`tests/test_concurrency_scalability.py` provides bounded fairness, 2,000-task runnable
queue, 5,000-sender/receiver cancellation storm, repeated lifecycle/GC batch,
and 20,000-value FIFO gates. The tests assert terminal queue drainage,
registration cleanup, entity reclamation, and no lost or duplicate values.

`python -m tools.benchmark_concurrency` emits JSON and optional CSV for spawn and
wait, suspended-task memory, context switches, repeated waits, scope close at
1/10/1,000 children (plus 100,000 with `--include-large`), unbuffered and bounded
channels, waiter cancellation, scalar/vector waits, small/large capture
transfer, copy-on-write fanout, parent/child detachment, lazy prefixes, and
scheduler overhead. Baselines are observational and deliberately do not impose
machine-dependent timing thresholds. Checked-in Linux results document the
initial comparison point.

### Plain linked C structs

A `link namespace.CName as &ValianceName => ... end` declaration registers a
plain fixed-layout FFI structure. Field order is preserved exactly in an
`FFIStructSpec`. Native call bytecode carries each required structure descriptor,
and the VM builds matching ABI layouts before invocation. Plain linked structs
have value semantics and may be accepted and returned by value. Opaque handles,
ownership-bearing pointer fields, and construction-dependent embedded arrays are
not included in the runtime.

## Scheduler-sensitive native calls

`CALL_NATIVE` remains synchronous during ordinary root execution. Inside a
scheduled task, the VM submits the host call to a bounded worker executor and
returns an explicit native-call suspension event. The owning task is blocked,
so other runnable tasks continue cooperatively.

Workers never mutate activation frames, VM stacks, task state, or scheduler
queues. A worker stores only its result or exception in an isolated completion
record, then publishes a callback to the scheduler's thread-safe external
completion queue. The scheduler commits that callback on its own execution
thread, marks the suspension complete, and schedules the owning task. The VM
places returned values on the stack only when that activation resumes.

The scheduler distinguishes deterministic mock wake registrations from
waitable host-worker registrations. If every task is blocked on real external
work, `run_until` waits on a condition variable rather than reporting deadlock
or busy-spinning. Existing mock registrations retain the prior explicit-wake
behavior.

Cancellation cannot safely interrupt an arbitrary C function. Cancelling a
blocked native call therefore unregisters its wake and abandons result delivery;
the worker may finish independently, but its result can no longer reach the VM.
This preserves prompt cooperative cancellation without allowing a host thread
to access released activation state.

### FFI boundary contracts

Primitive FFI conversion is compiler-owned but uses the ordinary `to[Target]`
conversion-selection path. The built-in catalogue registers checked conversions
for the C integer and floating families plus `&CString`, and reverse conversions
back to Valiance `Int`, `Real`, and `String`. Integer bounds are calculated from
the host C ABI through `ctypes.sizeof`; narrowing never wraps silently. CString
conversion rejects embedded null bytes. Raw `FFI.&Type(value)` constructors are
separate, explicitly unsafe operations and deliberately skip numeric range
validation.

The parser treats the adjacent component after `FFI.` as one qualified element,
so `FFI.&int(3)` lowers to the symbol `FFI.&int`, not two chained elements.
Compiler-owned conversions and constructors carry `Unsafe`; primitive native
links also contribute `Unsafe`, allowing ordinary function effect inference to
propagate the boundary transitively. User `@convert` definitions named `to`
continue to shadow the compiler catalogue and compile to their selected user
overload slot.

Native library handles and configured function objects are cached by canonical
library, symbol, parameter, result, struct, and handle metadata. Signature setup
is protected by a lock because `ctypes` function objects expose mutable
`argtypes` and `restype`. A `VirtualMachine` is an explicit managed resource:
`close()` is idempotent, context-manager exit shuts down its bounded worker
executor, and the convenience `run(...)` helper always closes its fresh VM.

### Flat buffers and embedded arrays

A rank-one FFI collection such as `&int+` is a flat native buffer boundary.
Compiler-owned `to[&Type+]` conversions validate every list item using the same
host-ABI range rules as scalar conversion and produce exact FFI element
values. At native invocation, the VM materializes contiguous `ctypes` array
storage and passes its pointer. That array object is owned by the worker call's
Python frame, so it remains pinned until the C function returns even when the
Valiance task is suspended or cancelled.

Linked struct fields may use `size => positive_integer` after a rank-one FFI
collection type. Analysis lowers each field into an `FFIFieldSpec` carrying the
native element spelling and fixed count. The VM generates an actual embedded C
array field, not a pointer, preserving declaration order, alignment, and
`sizeof` behavior. Returned embedded arrays are copied into immutable
`FFIBufferValue` instances.

Flat buffers are borrowed for one native call. C cannot retain the pointer.
Pointer-length relationships and output or input-output buffers are not
represented by the current ownership and direction metadata.

### Opaque-handle destruction and leases

A raw native destructor is declared with `@destroy link`. Analysis requires one
opaque-handle parameter and no return value. The compiler records the destroyed
parameter index in `NativeCallReference`, and bytecode version 0x26 preserves
that metadata explicitly.

`FFIHandleValue` is one shared runtime identity. Native calls acquire a lease on
every distinct handle argument before C receives an address and release those
leases only after C returns. A destructor request immediately prevents new calls
but delays final invalidation until all earlier leases are released. This also
covers scheduled native calls: task cancellation abandons result delivery, not
the worker's lease, so the handle cannot become invalid while C is still using
it.

Destruction is explicit. `@destroy` guarantees one successful
native free call invalidates the shared handle and a repeated destroy or later
use fails before entering C. Automatic final-release destructor attachment and
Computed linked fields use separate declarations and runtime metadata.

### Ownership-qualified native returns

`@owned("free_symbol")` marks a native pointer return whose allocation must be
copied into Valiance-owned storage and then released by a one-pointer function
from the same library. The physical C result is always captured as `void*`, so
`ctypes` cannot discard the allocation address while decoding a C string.

For `&CString`, the VM copies bytes through the first null terminator and decodes
them as strict UTF-8. For a primitive flat buffer, `size = N` supplies the exact
number of elements to copy into an immutable `FFIBufferValue`. In both cases the
free function runs in a `finally` block. It therefore executes exactly once when
copying succeeds, UTF-8 decoding fails, element conversion fails, or another
conversion exception is raised.

`@nullable` is permitted with `@owned`. A null address becomes `None` and is not
passed to the free function. Without `@nullable`, a null owned return is a runtime
fault. Returned native memory is fully copied and freed on the worker thread
before a scheduled result becomes observable, so cancellation cannot expose or
leak partially converted native storage.

Owned-return metadata is part of `NativeLinkSpec` and `NativeCallReference` and
is serialized in bytecode version 0x27. The free symbol, optional fixed count,
and nullability bit are validated while loading bytecode.

### Computed linked fields

Linked struct field analysis consumes `FFIFieldSpec` directly. Scalar fields
retain their exact open FFI type, fixed embedded arrays become exact rank-one FFI
collections, and nested linked structures remain linked types for further field
selection. Linked fields are read-only at the Valiance level, preserving native
value-layout immutability and preventing writes that bypass C ABI reconstruction.

The call-analysis compatibility path also recognizes linked layouts when an
existing generic call transformation has temporarily preserved only the nominal
name. It re-establishes the FFI family solely when that name is present in the
analyser's linked-struct registry. Unrelated nominal objects are therefore not
reclassified as foreign values.

Runtime native-field conversion recursively reconstructs nested linked structs,
and native argument conversion accepts those reconstructed linked values inside
outer structs. Embedded arrays remain immutable `FFIBufferValue` instances.
These properties survive optimizer lowering and bytecode serialization.

### Declared linked-return conversions

A native link may distinguish its physical ABI return from its visible Valiance
return with `-> (VisibleType) &PhysicalType`. During setup analysis, the link
selects exactly one registered `@convert(PhysicalType -> VisibleType)` overload.
Complete same-module conversion signatures are prescanned before links, while all
other definitions retain the established post-setup prescan order so object and
variant semantics are unaffected.

The native call itself still returns the physical FFI value. Compiler lowering
emits `CALL_NATIVE` followed immediately by a statically resolved call to the
selected conversion overload. No dynamic target lookup occurs at runtime. The
conversion therefore survives optimization and bytecode serialization using
existing portable call references, without adding host-specific callable state
to `NativeCallReference`.

The link's visible overload return is the converted type. Its effect set includes
both `Unsafe` from the native boundary and every effect declared by the selected
conversion. Missing and ambiguous conversion declarations are rejected during
analysis. Parameters remain unconverted and continue to require explicit
`to[...]` calls.

### Callback trampolines and scheduler handoff

Native links may declare callback parameters with ordinary `Function[...]`
types whose inputs and optional single return are primitive C-compatible types.
Analysis lowers each callback parameter into a portable `FFICallbackSpec`
containing the native parameter index and canonical ABI spellings. Bytecode
version 0x28 serializes these descriptors without serializing closure instances.

At invocation the VM builds a `ctypes.CFUNCTYPE` trampoline and pins it in the
native-call frame until C returns. Calls arriving on the VM thread invoke the
closure directly. Calls arriving on a C-created or native-worker thread enqueue
a request through the scheduler's external-completion queue and block only that
originating host thread. The scheduler thread converts callback arguments,
invokes the closure, validates its result count, converts the result to the C
representation, and wakes the host thread.

Callback exceptions and panics never unwind through C. The trampoline returns a
zero-compatible ABI value, records the first fault, and the containing native
call raises after C returns. Scheduled native calls retain their normal
external-wake registration, so callback requests remain serviceable while the
calling task is suspended. Callback trampolines are call-scoped;
C must not retain them after the linked function returns.


#### Public task cancellation and logical deadlines

`cancel` and `timeout` are analyser-recognized concurrency primitives rather
than ordinary built-ins. Dedicated typed nodes lower to `CANCEL_TASK` and
`TIMEOUT_TASK`, preserving fixed stack effects in bytecode version 0x29.
Cancellation delegates to `TaskControlBlock.request_cancel()`, including its
blocked-operation wake and cleanup behavior. Timeout registers both a target
completion waiter and a scheduler logical timer. The committed path cancels
the other registration; deadline expiry requests target cancellation and the
waiter observes the resulting terminal state. Root-frame timeouts use
`Scheduler.wait()` under the same timer registration. No host-thread sleep or
wall-clock time enters deterministic scheduling.

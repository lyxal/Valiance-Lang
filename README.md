# The Valiance Programming Language

Array languages are cool, but horribly unoptimised for mainstream usage.
Valiance rectifies this by providing a stack array language
that has been designed with mainstream appeal in mind.

It is boring compared to other array languages, but that's the point. We don't
need production code to look like a hex dump experiment, nor does it need to
be something that is an "adventure". It just needs to work. Valiance does that.

## But Where's the Code?

Okay so at this stage, I don't have any actual implementation. Only specs and
planning documents. And I don't think I'll be able to work on implementation
for a while because University is back for the year, and it's
going to get rather busy. Therefore, I figured it'd be best to share
the design plans I've come up with so far.

[This overview file contains the best known plans and features at this stage](https://github.com/lyxal/Valiance-Lang/blob/main/new-docs/overview%20as%20code.vlnc)

## Can I Implement This?

Well, technically I can't stop you from doing so. But I'd strongly recommend
not doing so because things are likely to change without notice. Features
haven't been finalised yet, so probably hold off for a while.
